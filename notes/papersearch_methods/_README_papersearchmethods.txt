Working on updated methods for new manuscripts
Relevant GitHub issues: checking for new papers 234 (entering new papers has a few ... starts with 291 I think)

- We previously wrote
	TOPIC = (budburst OR leaf-out) AND (photoperiod OR daylength) AND temperature*, which yielded 85 publications
	TOPIC = (budburst OR leaf-out) AND dorman*, which yielded 193 publications
- I reviewed lit.rev.notes.Dec2018.txt and lit.rev.notes.June2019.txt
- Based on the numbers in those files I assume they represent ADDITIONAL numbers after our first OPSREE database work so I am adding them in:

TOPIC = (budburst OR leaf-out) AND (photoperiod OR daylength) AND temperature*, which yielded 85 + (30+421) + (89+7) = 623 publications
	TOPIC = (budburst OR leaf-out) AND dorman*, which yielded 193 + (41+22) + (10+4) =  270 publications
