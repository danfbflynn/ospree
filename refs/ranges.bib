	abstract = {{Projected changes in temperature and precipitation are expected to
   influence spring and autumn vegetation phenology and hence the length of
   the growing season in many ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of
   green-up and senescence to climate remains uncertain. We analyzed 488
   site years of canopy greenness measurements from deciduous forest
   broadleaf forests across North America. We found that the sensitivity of
   green-up to temperature anomalies increases with increasing mean annual
   temperature, suggesting lower temperature sensitivity as we move to
   higher latitudes. Furthermore, autumn senescence is most sensitive to
   moisture deficits at dry sites, with decreasing sensitivity as mean
   annual precipitation increases. Future projections suggest North
   American deciduous forests will experience higher sensitivity to
   temperature in the next 50 years, with larger changes expected in
   northern regions than in southern regions. Our study highlights how
   interactions between long-term and short-term changes in the climate
   system influence green-up and senescence.
   Plain Summary language Vegetation activity is sensitive to climate
   change, but relatively few studies have quantified this across large
   spatial extents. We used a large dataset of leaf color derived from
   digital images to look at how the timing of green-up and fall senescence
   vary in relation to environmental factors across North America. We found
   that green-up is more sensitive to temperature at warmer sites, but fall
   is more sensitive to moisture availability. If the climate continues to
   change as currently projected, we predict that the timing of spring will
   exhibit more dramatic swings in onset, but the timing of autumn will
   likely become less sensitive to moisture availability in the next 50
   years.}},

	n2 = {Abstract The impact of climate warming on the advancement of plant spring phenology has been heavily investigated over the last decade and there exists great variability among plants in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. However, few studies have explicitly linked phenological sensitivity to local climate variance. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that the strength of phenological sensitivity declines with increased local spring temperature variance, by synthesizing results across ground observations. We assemble ground-based long-term (20?50 years) spring phenology database (PEP725 database) and the corresponding climate dataset. We find a prevalent decline in the strength of phenological sensitivity with increasing local spring temperature variance at the species level from ground observations. It suggests that plants might be less likely to track climatic warming at locations with larger local spring temperature variance. This might be related to the possibility that the frost risk could be higher in a larger local spring temperature variance and plants adapt to avoid this risk by relying more on other cues (e.g., high chill requirements, photoperiod) for spring phenology, thus suppressing phenological responses to spring warming. This study illuminates that local spring temperature variance is an understudied source in the study of phenological sensitivity and highlight the necessity of incorporating this factor to improve the predictability of plant responses to anthropogenic climate change in future studies.},

	abstract = {The christening of the decline in the geographic extent of species from high to low latitudes as Rapoport's rule was a bold step. Allowing for a variety of potentially significant complications to the interpretation of empirical studies, evidence that this is indeed a general pattern is, at the very least, equivocal. The present taxonomically and regionally biased set of studies lend support to the recent suggestion that the pattern is a local phenomenon being expressed primarily in the Palaearctic and Nearctic above latitudes of 40--50$\,^{\circ}$N. Five hypotheses have been proposed to explain the generation of latitudinal declines in range size where they do occur, with the past heavy emphasis on a climatic variability mechanism being eroded. Evidence is accruing in support of more than one such mechanism. Whatever the generality of the `rule', it has undoubtedly served to stimulate a consideration of the role of spatial variation in range sizes in several areas of research in ecology and evolution.},

We tested this hypothesis using experiments in 215 species and leaf-out monitoring in 1585 species from East Asia (EA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA). The results reveal that species from regions with high STV indeed have higher winter chilling requirements, and, when grown under the same conditions, leaf out later than related species from regions with lower STV. Since 1900, STV has been consistently higher in NA than in EU and EA, and under experimentally short winter conditions NA species required 84{\%} more spring warming for bud break, EU ones 49{\%} and EA ones only 1{\%}. These previously unknown continental-scale differences in phenological strategies underscore the need for considering regional climate histories in global change models.},

	n2 = {Abstract It is well known that increased spring temperatures cause earlier onset dates of leaf unfolding and flowering. However, a temperature increase in winter may be associated with delayed development when species' chilling requirements are not fulfilled. Furthermore, photosensitivity is supposed to interfere with temperature triggers. To date, neither the relative importance nor possible interactions of these three factors have been elucidated. In this study, we present a multispecies climate chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling and photoperiod on the spring phenology of 36 woody species. Several hypotheses regarding their variation with species traits (successional strategy, floristic status, climate of their native range) were tested. Long photoperiods advanced budburst for one-third of the studied species, but magnitudes of these effects were generally minor. In contrast to prior hypotheses, photosensitive responses were not restricted to climax or oceanic species. Increased chilling length advanced budburst for almost all species; its effect greatly exceeding that of photoperiod. Moreover, we suggest that photosensitivity and chilling effects have to be rigorously disentangled, as the response to photoperiod was restricted to individuals that had not been fully chilled. The results indicate that temperature requirements and successional strategy are linked, with climax species having higher chilling and forcing requirements than pioneer species. Temperature requirements of invasive species closely matched those of native species, suggesting that high phenological concordance is a prerequisite for successful establishment. Lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in budburst but also caused substantial changes in the chronological order of species' budburst. The results reveal that increased winter temperatures might impact forest ecosystems more than formerly assumed. Species with lower chilling requirements, such as pioneer or invasive species, might profit from warming winters, if late spring frost events would in parallel occur earlier.},

We compared observed range sizes, measured in either one (latitudinal or longitudinal extent) or two dimensions (range area), with three null models that respected constraints imposed by the geometry of the continent; we tested whether climatic gradients could account for increasing range size with latitude ? a Rapoport effect ? in North American trees; and whether variation in range size was associated with phylogeny or ecological characteristics of species. We documented an excess of species with small ranges and a lack of widely distributed species compared with null expectations both with and without environmental constraints. We found evidence for a Rapoport effect in North American trees, at different taxonomic levels and for different groups defined by ecological characteristics. This pattern is not an outcome constrained by continental shape and does not depend on the metric for range size, but it is consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis proposed to explain the Rapoport pattern. Finally we showed that trees east of the Rocky Mountains have larger ranges on average than trees to the west or in Mexico and that the proportion of deciduous compared to evergreen species increases with range size. Variation in range size among North American trees is not spatially random, and has a phylogenetic and ecological signal. Consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis, range size of North American trees increases with increasing variability in annual temperature range at higher latitudes.},

We use the largest botanical data set assembled to date to quantify geographical variation in range size for \~{} 85 000 plant species across the New World. We assess prominent hypothesised range-size controls, finding that plant range sizes are codetermined by habitat area and long- and short-term climate stability. Strong short- and long-term climate instability in large parts of North America, including past glaciations, are associated with broad-ranged species. In contrast, small habitat areas and a stable climate characterise areas with high concentrations of small-ranged species in the Andes, Central America and the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest region. The joint roles of area and climate stability strengthen concerns over the potential effects of future climate change and habitat loss on biodiversity.},

@article{Muffler2016,
	abstract = {{AimCold events determine the distributional range limits of woody
   species. Despite global warming, the magnitude of late frost events in
   boreal and temperate regions is not expected to change. Hence, the risk
   for late spring frost damage of woody species may increase with an
   earlier onset of the growing season. Here, we investigated
   biogeographical, phenological and phylogenetic effects on late frost
   sensitivity.
   LocationEcological-Botanical Gardens Bayreuth, Germany (49 degrees
   5545N, 11 degrees 3510E).
   MethodsWe inspected 170 woody species in the Ecological-Botanical
   Gardens from across the entire Northern Hemisphere for frost damage
   after an extreme late frost event in May 2011 (air temperature -4.3
   degrees C after leaf unfolding of all species). Distribution range
   characteristics, climatic parameters of place of origin and phenological
   strategy were linked to sensitivity to the late frost event.
   ResultsThe northern distribution limit and the range in continentality
   across the distributional ranges correlated negatively with a taxon's
   late frost sensitivity (pseudo-R-2=0.42, pseudo-R-2=0.33, respectively).
   Sensitivity to the late frost event was well explained by the climatic
   conditions within species' native ranges (boosted regression trees;
   receiver operating characteristic 0.737). Average (1950-2000) May
   minimum temperature in species' native ranges was the main explanatory
   variable of late frost sensitivity (51.7\% of explained variance).
   Phylogenetic relatedness explained additional variance in sensitivity to
   the late frost event. Sensitivity to the late frost event further
   correlates well with species phenological strategy. Frost-tolerant
   species flushed on average 2 weeks earlier than frost-sensitive species.
   Main conclusionsRange characteristics and the prevalent climatic
   parameters across species native ranges are strongly related to their
   susceptibility to late spring frost damage. Further, more late
   frost-sensitive species unfolded their leaves later than more tolerant
   species and late frost tolerance is phylogenetically conserved. Thus,
   late frost sensitivity may challenge natural and human-assisted
   migration of woody species under global warming.}},

@article{Guo2020,
	abstract = {{Late frost can cause damage to trees, especially to the developing bud
   of broadleaf species in spring. Through long-term adaptation, plants
   adjust leaf phenology to achieve an optimal trade-off between growing
   season length and frost avoidance. In this study, we aim to assess
   ecotypic differentiation in leaf development of sugar maple populations
   planted in a common garden. A total of 272 sugar maple seedlings from 29
   Canadian provenances were planted at the northern boundary of the
   natural range, and the phenological phases of bud and leaf development
   were monitored during spring 2019. The wide geographical area under
   evaluation showed a complex seasonal pattern of temperature, with spring
   warming occurring later in the north and close to the sea. Overall, leaf
   development lasted between 20 and 36 days, from the end of May to end of
   June. We observed different timings and rates of leaf development among
   provenances, demonstrating the occurrence of ecotypes in this species.
   Minimum April temperatures of the original sites were able to explain
   such differences, while maximum April temperatures were not significant.
   Seedlings from sites with colder minimum April temperatures completed
   leaf development earlier and faster. On average, leaf development
   diverged by up to 6 days among provenances, with minimum April
   temperatures ranging from -3 to 3 degrees C. Our results demonstrated
   that the avoidance of late spring frost is a driving force of leaf
   development in sugar maple populations. In the colder sites, the growing
   season is a limiting factor for tree growth. Thus, when thermal
   conditions become favorable in spring, an earlier growth reactivation
   and high metabolic activity ensure a fast leaf emission, which maximizes
   the period available for photosynthesis and growth. These patterns
   demonstrate the long-term phenological adaptation of sugar maple
   populations to local climatic conditions and suggest the importance of
   frost events for leaf development.}},

	n2 = {With increasing concern about the ecological consequences of global climate change, there has been renewed interest in understanding the processes that determine species range limits. We tested a long-hypothesized trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate that is often used to explain species range limits. We grew 24 willow and poplar species (family Salicaceae) collected from across North America in a greenhouse common garden under two climate treatments. Maximum entropy models were used to describe species distributions and to estimate species-specific climate parameters. A range of traits related to freezing tolerance, including senescence, budburst, and susceptibility to different temperature minima during and after acclimation were measured. As predicted, species from colder climates exhibited higher freezing tolerance and slower growth rates than species from warmer climates under certain environmental conditions. However, the average relative growth rate (millimeters per meter per day) of northern species markedly increased when a subset of species was grown under a long summer day length (20.5 h), indicating that genetically based day-length cues are required for growth regulation in these species. We conclude that the observed relationship between freezing tolerance and growth rate is not driven by differences in species' intrinsic growth capacity but by differences in the environmental cues that trigger growth. We propose that the coordinated evolution of freezing tolerance and growth phenology could be important in circumscribing willow and poplar range limits and may have important implications for species' current and future distributions.},

@article{Park2019,
	abstract = {{Phenology is a key biological trait that can determine an organism's
   survival and provides one of the clearest indicators of the effects of
   recent climatic change. Long time-series observations of plant phenology
   collected at continental scales could clarify latitudinal and regional
   patterns of plant responses and illuminate drivers of that variation,
   but few such datasets exist. Here, we use the web tool CrowdCurio to
   crowdsource phenological data from over 7000 herbarium specimens
   representing 30 diverse flowering plant species distributed across the
   eastern United States. Our results, spanning 120 years and generated
   from over 2000 crowdsourcers, illustrate numerous aspects of
   continental-scale plant reproductive phenology. First, they support
   prior studies that found plant reproductive phenology significantly
   advances in response to warming, especially for early-flowering species.
   Second, they reveal that fruiting in populations from warmer, lower
   latitudes is significantly more phenologically sensitive to temperature
   than that for populations from colder, higher-latitude regions. Last, we
   found that variation in phenological sensitivities to climate within
   species between regions was of similar magnitude to variation between
   species. Overall, our results suggest that phenological responses to
   anthropogenic climate change will be heterogeneous within communities
   and across regions, with large amounts of regional variability driven by
   local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and differences in species
   assemblages. As millions of imaged herbarium specimens become available
   online, they will play an increasingly critical role in revealing
   large-scale patterns within assemblages and across continents that
   ultimately can improve forecasts of the impacts of climatic change on
   the structure and function of ecosystems.
