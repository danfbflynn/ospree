# PhenoPhyloMM
Repository with data and code to conduct analyses in "Phylogenetic estimates of species-level phenology improve ecological forecasting". 

The repo includes data and annotated code to conduct models in Stan and to analyse model outcomes in R.

This project is part of a larger project on Phylogenetic Mixed Models (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/pmm) and uses data generated under the "Observed Spring Phenology Responses in Ã‰xperimental Environments" (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree). The full dataset and subsets of it used for additional projects can be found in https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F18P5XZF.
