Nacho says: Please note that in order to deal with LaTeX errors and all the NCC formatting requirements (including bibliography in-text, etc., it was a pain) I had to generate new latex files for the ms., the extended data, etc. (see now the updated push with everything). So the final ms. file is PhenoPhylo_ms_submit_wbib.pdf.

Lizzie adds: PhenoPhylo_ms.rnw was the main file BEFORE final NCC formatting.
