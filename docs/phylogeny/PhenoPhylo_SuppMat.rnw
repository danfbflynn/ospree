\subsection*{Interpretation of $\lambda_j$ and $\sigma_j^2$ on slopes and intercepts}

Most current phylogenetic regression approaches aimed at controlling for phylogenetic non-independence of analysis units \citep[i.e. species, see][]{revell2010phylogenetic} assume the $\lambda$ scaling parameter is constant across the full set of predictors in the model. Thus, $\lambda$ is estimated as a single parameter based on one single residual term VCV matrix. While useful for correcting for phylogenetic non-independence this approach does not allow the phylogeny to differentially affect different predictors (i.e. environmental cues in our example). In models with multiple cues, species responses to all cues are estimated as similarly phylogenetically structured, but this may not be the case. For example, in a PGLS model with three cues, it would be possible to have a high (i.e. close to 1) value of $\lambda$, due to either a strong phylogenetic signal in the response, but no phylogenetic structuring in the cues, or one or more predictors being strongly phylogenetically structured. In the latter case, phylogenetic structuring of responses to cues could be correlated (i.e., responses to cues evolving in a correlated fashion) or uncorrelated (i.e., independent evolution of responses to cues). Discerning these different situations is not trivial as they would inform whether responses to predictors configure in a structured fashion along the evolutionary process. However, most current approaches act as a black box regarding this information; they simply inform whether or not model residuals are phylogenetically structured (i.e. in PGLS) or the amount of model variance attributable to the phylogeny and independent from other sources of variation (i.e., in PMM, see \cite{housworth2004phylogenetic}).\\

Because we are specifically interested in estimating the phylogenetic structure of each cue, our approach explicitly partitions variance into specific components relative to the model intercept and predictor (cue) slopes (see equation \ref{eqfive}). The multivariate normal distributions of the intercept and slope terms include each a variance term (see equation \ref{phybetas}), modelled with a $\lambda$ scaling parameter. The interpretation of $\lambda$s in our models are analogous to Pagel's $\lambda$  \citep{pagel1999inferring} parameter \citep{housworth2004phylogenetic}, constrained to range from 0 to 1, with values of 0 indicating absence of phylogenetic relatedness, and values of 1 indicating \emph{Brownian Motion} evolution (BM). Estimated $\lambda$s are not fully equivalent to computing phylogenetic signal of the slopes of each cue separately (i.e., fitting a multilevel regression model with species as a grouping factor on intercepts, and subsequently estimating phylogenetic signal for model slopes). Instead, they are a relative metric of phylogenetic relatedness allowing us to compare among responses known to interact with each other and estimated simultaneously. This approach has the further benefit of adjusting our partial pooling (`random effect' of species) based on evolutionary distance, more strongly pooling closely related species, and only weakly pooling distantly related species \citep[see Gaussian process models in][]{BDA}. \\% While most current approaches compute only one $\lambda$, our approach computes four, one independent of the predictors, and one for each predictor.

A traditional interpretation of $\sigma^2$s under Brownian Motion evolution, is an `evolutionary rate' or phenotypic accumulation over time \citep{revell2008phylogenetic}. In PGLS, $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ is estimated for the model error term, which is distributed as a multivariate normal with VCV matrix given by $\sigma_\epsilon^2$$\boldsymbol{\Sigma_i}$. Here, similar to our approach to $\lambda$, we estimate four $\sigma^2$ values, corresponding to each model parameter. In our particular case (i.e., modelling a phenological response to three environmental cues), $\sigma_\alpha^2$ for the intercept could be interpreted as the phenological variation across species accummulated along evolution independently from the cues. The $\sigma_\beta_1^2$, $\sigma_\beta_2^2$, and $\sigma_\beta_3^2$, corresponding to model slopes, would represent the phylogenetic variance linked to species responses to each of the modelled cues (i.e., forcing, chilling, and photoperiod, respectively). This is, the variability in how species shift their phenology responding to temperature and light, accummulated along the evolutionary process and considered in concert. \\
