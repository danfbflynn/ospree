Not sure if the rates are great (given the quality of our data, but as J says 'it's easy to do, so, you know, why not?' and the community assembly stuff (which doesn't apply here as we don't have community data) requires 'being sensible to the current literature.'",Mid-high: See section starting on 3636 for a nice overview,
