\section*{Results \& Discussion}

Most species are sensitive to all three primary cues---forcing, chilling, and photoperiod (Figs. \ref{fig:muplot_all}, Supporting Table \ref{tab:})\citep[see also][]{Laube:2014a,ettinger2020}---with sensitivity to chilling approximately five-fold greater than sensitivity to photoperiod, on average (phenological advances of 7.2 days per standardized unit vs 1.4 days, for chilling and photoperiod, respectively; see Table \ref{tab:modelanglamb}). However, these average sensitivities estimated across species, fail to capture the large differences in species' responses to chilling and forcing (Figs. \ref{fig:muplot_all}, Supporting Table \ref{tab:}). 

By allowing species responses to vary, based on a model including their shared evolutionary history, we found species differences dwarfed differences between cues, especially temperature cues (Fig. \ref{fig:muplot_all}). The largest in magnitude cue---chilling---varied 25-fold between species, while variation to forcing varied 6-fold. These results suggest the strong focus on comparing cues may miss the largest variation. Robust phenological forecasts must then account for both the complexity of multiple cues and species-level variation in responses to them.

\emph{Differences across clades \& cues}

The large differences across species generally occurred coherently within clades, producing striking differences between clades. Oaks and beeches (Fagaceae), elms (Ulmaceae) and buckthorns (Rhamnaceae) are highly sensitive to chilling while rhododendrons (Ericaceae), butterfly bushes (Scrophulariaceae) or spindles (Celastraceae) show little to no response to chilling (Fig. \ref{fig:muplot_all} a). %IMC: not sure if we need some natural history here or some mention to research for some of these clades. Lizzie, if you want to mention-cite something here, please jump in. % EMW (21Nov2022 and 1 Dec2022) I can work with JD to add more here later.
% JD I think some biogeography may be useful here, for example, I think rhododendrons & buddleia are native to the Himalaya, but both are also now widespread and invasive ... need to do a little more digging on the exact species.   
Similar clade-level variation was observed for forcing, where some of these clades---e.g., Ericaceae, Rhamnaceae, Ulmaceae, or Fagaceae---were particularly sensitive (advancing their budburst more than 10 days per standardized unit of forcing) and others such as the Sapindaceae, Cornaceae or Juglandaceae families show little response (Fig. \ref{fig:muplot_all} b). %JD - perhaps could link back to invasiveness? Species more sensitive to forcing more invasive?

Some species responded strongly to both temperature cues (chilling and forcing), which could suggest the existence of syndromes where the genetic basis for responses to one cue (e.g., forcing) has been been selected for alongside responses to another cue (e.g. chilling). We might expect, for example, early-season species to be sensitive to multiple cues as mistiming phenology could result in exposure to harsh conditions, leading to tissue loss or death \citep{frostbook}, and sensitivity to multiple cues likely provides greater insurance against mistiming \citep{memegan2021}. Alternatively or additionally, linkage or pleiotropism among loci associated with sensitivity to different cues \citep{nakagawa2005} could induce correlated cues. However, the correlation in species sensitivities across cues was weak (\emph{r} = 0.31; between forcing an chilling) and some genera, such as \emph{Tilia} and Ericaceae[genus?], displayed strong responses to forcing but weak responses to chilling, while others, such as XXXXExamplesXXXX, show strong responses to chilling but weak responses to forcing (Fig. \ref{fig:muplot_all}). Species sensitivity to one cue, thus, does not constrain sensitivity to another cue, and selection might operate independently on responses to different cues \citep{bonamour2019}.

In contrast to both chilling and forcing, species-level responses to photoperiod were almost uniform---present across nearly all species. This provides novel insight on a large debate over the prevalence of photoperiod cues in temperate trees, where previous experiments  \citep{Basler:2012,zohner2016} and modeling exercises \citep[e.g.,][]{Hunter:1992jw,schaber20203} suggested important variability across species that may constrain the responses of certain species to warming \citep{way2015}. Our results suggest variability is constrained to a very limit set of species in Fagaceae, which have been heavily studied, including \emph{Fagus sylvatica} \citep[e.g.,][]{Basler:2012,zohner2016,kramer2017}. These same few species are also where most evidence of local adaptation in photoperiod cues for spring phenology comes from \citep[e.g.,][]{kramer2017}, in contrast with common garden studies of other species, which found little evidence of local adaptation in spring (but not fall) phenology \citep{aitken2016}. The uniformity of response to photoperiod that we found supports this latter view of generally low local adaptation in photoperiod cues for spring phenology: given that studies spanned a range of latitudes (with many species studied in only a narrow latitudinal range), if local adaptation was high in photoperiod cues we would expect more variability across species. 

Our results suggest that while chilling and forcing are the dominant cues in terms of the magnitude of their effect sizes, most species are also sensitive to photoperiod, highlighting the potential importance of this cue to both climate change responses in the future, and through evolutionary history. In plants, photoperiod regulates a number of fundamental processes including growth, flowering, stress tolerance, and circadian rhythm \citep{serrano2017,Singh:2017}, with photoperiodic sensing and adaptation to shifting daylength likely occurred early in the evolution of plants, with origins in the green algae \citep{serrano2017}. It is possible, therefore, that phenological responses to photoperiod reflect ancestral sensitivities with origins in deep time. Large plasticity in responses to additional environmental cues (e.g., temperature) for a given photoperiod cue \citep[e.g.,][]{kramer1995} may allow species to track interannual variation in climate with little directional selection on photoperiod sensitivities. Alternatively, photoperiod might thus provide a reliable calibration of the underlying biological clock \citep{jackson2009plant} upon which seasonal variation in climate modifies the tempo. 
%JD - I still need to get to grips with what is going on with photoperiod, low lambda is consistent with rapid evolution within species, but low sigma suggests low rates of evolution. Perhaps photoperiod is dominated by local adaptation, but little directional selection, so local adaptation just gets washed out overtime?

\emph{Phylogenetic structure of phenological cues}

Variation---or lack thereof---in cues across species and clades, alongside related estimates from our modeling approach, provides possible insights into the evolution of cues across the phylogeny. While responses to each cue were phylogenetically structured, the strength of phylogenetic conservatism in response differs between cues (Fig. \ref{fig:phylosig_all}). Responses to temperature (forcing and chilling) were moderately structured ($\lambda = 0.65$ and $\lambda = 0.54$, for forcing and chilling, respectively), with closely related species exhibiting more similar sensitivities than distantly related species. Phylogenetic structure in species responses to photoperiod was comparatively weaker ($\lambda= 0.39$) (see Fig. \ref{Fig:muplot_all}, Table \ref{tab:modelanglamb}), emphasizing again that photoperiod diverges from other climate cues. In addition to be weaker and more uniform across species, sensitivity to photoperiod appears to also be less evolutionarily constrained than sensitivities to temperature cues. While our approach is unique in focusing on species cues, our results support previous work showing phylogenetic signal in plant phenological timing observed from floras or long-term data \cite{kochmer1986constraints,davies2013phylogenetic} 

What might drive phylogenetic structure in species temperature responses? Differences between species in their responses represent shifts in the slope of the relationship between the observed phenology and the cue. Thus, the observed phylogenetic structure in temperature responses (forcing and chilling) would be consistent with an interaction with a non-measured trait that moderates responses, and which also covaries with phylogeny \citep{davies2019phylogenetically}. This fits fundamentally with the idea that early-season phenology plays a critical role in shaping species temporal niches \citep{gotelli1996} and thus should covary with a suite of life-history traits, including whether species are early-active with other rapid return on investment trait, or start later in the season but have higher competitive abilities \citep[e.g.,][]{Grime:1977sw,wolkovich2014aob}. Geography may drive structured phylogenetic variation, especially in regions where clades have radiated such that close relatives have experienced the same suite of environmental cues and thus been subject to similar selection regimes. Conversely, if species are not generally geographically constrained, as may be more likely the case, especially across deep time \citep{fitzturelli2006}, then we might expect phylogenetic structure in phenology to also weaken, especially when aggregating across locations with different cues \citep{davies2013phylogenetic}.

% EMW (21Nov2022): Do we want to mention any molecular work on photoperiod (or other cues)?
Weak phylogenetic signal in photoperiod sensitivity (Fig. \ref{fig:phylosig_all}) might seem at odds with observations that distantly related species respond more similarly (and less variably) to photoperiod than they do to forcing or chilling. However, somewhat counterintuitively, both uniform and random responses can manifest as low phylogenetic signal when indexed by Brownian motion expectations (see Wiens et al.). Rapid local adaptation within species might thus erase the phylogenetic structure in photoperiod responses, but would seem at odds with the uniformity in species' responses. Alternatively, if responses to photoperiod evolved early in plants, as we suggest above, and subsequent selection on photoperiod sensitivity was constrained by stabilizing selection operating on other life-history attributes sensitive to photoperiod (XXCITE), we would predict both low interspecific variation and weak phylogenetic signal in responses, matching observations. This latter interpretation is also consistent with our estimates of lower $\sigma$ for photoperiod responses (CITE FIGURE). Here, as in more traditional phylogenetic comparative methods, $\sigma$ represents the rate of evolution, and thus our model suggests photoperiod responses are also evolving slower than temperature responses. However, we also reveal (see Appendix XXX) that an early burst model of evolution, in which trait variation accumulates rapidly early in the history of a clade and then slows through time, consistent with our interpretation of photoperiod evolution.
%JD - Call out to Will for assistance ...

Phylogenetic conservatism (high $\lambda$) and slow evolutionary rates (low $\sigma$) in traits has sometimes been interpreted as indicative of evolutionary constraints to adaptive change (cite Wiens et al. and others cites XXX). If this were the case, we might then suggest that species with strong forcing response might be more vulnerable to future warming spring temperatures because phylogenetic signal in responses to forcing is strong, while species may be able to better adapt to changes in chilling as $\lambda$ is lower, and $\sigma$ is higher. However, this is misleading as estimates of lambda are independent from the rate of evolution, and macroevolutionary rates estimated on phylogenetic trees are integrate across millions of years of evolutionary history, and thus do not necessarily inform us of maximum possible rates of evolution over shorter timescales. Indeed, there is accumulating evidence for rapid evolution to warming climate ... (cites XXXX). We highlight these parameter here to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of species phenological cues, and to underscore the importance of correctly modelling species differences in ecological forecasts. 


% I'm commenting out this bit but leave it here in case we want to mention some of it in methods or an appendix
%From a statistical perspective, accounting for the effects of phylogenetic structuring on the effects of jointly modelled cues had an effect on model coefficients (Fig. \ref{fig:correls_angio}). Not accounting for phylogeny (or assuming $\lambda$ = 0) biased model coefficients, particularly so for forcing and somewhat less for chilling (Fig. \ref{fig:correls_angio}). Specifically, species sensitivities to forcing and chilling were underestimated on average (model slopes shifted by 7.2\% and 3.7\%, respectively). Sensitivities to photoperiod, which showed weak phylogenetic signal were not biased in non-phylogenetic models (Fig. \ref{fig:correls_angio}), likely associated to their low estimated $\lambda$ values. Model intercepts were not affected either (Fig. \ref{fig:correls_angio}).\\ 

\emph{Forecasting species-level responses}

% EMW (21Nov2022): I suggest we drop lamba=1 to keep this short and restructure a little ... maybe something like 'even though average slopes did not change so much ... we saw important changes across species when including the phylogeny' or such? I am happy to work on this after we discuss. 
Not accounting for phylogeny had an effect on model coefficients (model slopes for forcing and chilling shifted by 7.2\% and 3.7\%, respectively; Fig. \ref{fig:correls_angio}) and shifted cross-species variance in their responses to forcing (Var $\beta_{phylo}$ = 8.74; Var $\beta_{non-phylo}$ = 5.01), chilling (Var $\beta_{phylo}$ = 23.45; Var $\beta_{non-phylo}$ = 17.47), and photoperiod responses (Var $\beta_{phylo}$ = 0.82; Var $\beta_{non-phylo}$ = 0.93). Counterintuitively, induced reductions in cross-species variance, far from increasing estimation accuracy could lead to increased type-II error by failing to detect actual relationships among cue and responses that would only emerge when phylogeny is correctly accounted for (see Supporting Information XX). Either ignoring ($\lambda$ = 0) or overestimating phylogenetic structuring of predictors ($\lambda$ = 1) can bias model coefficients (predictors with high $\lambda$ are biased in non-phylogenetic models and those with low $\lambda$ are biased if Brownian Motion is imposed). Importantly, not accounting for phylogeny increased the uncertainty around each individual species estimation of their responses to forcing and chilling (see Fig. SXX in Supporting Information), which could lead to less precise predictions and forecasts of phenology for individual species although overall model accuracy might still appear reasonable (see Appendix XX in Supporting Information).
%IMC: I merged and tried to condense these statistical findings. Probably the paragraph can still use some work.

%IMC- I'm commenting out this paragraph as I'm not sure we want to discuss intercepts. in 20nov meeting we decided not to talk about this unless Will feels we should and has something to add to this paragraph.
%Our models found non-negligible phylogenetic signal in model intercepts (see \ref{fig:phylosig_all}). This indicates that the intrinsic variation across species in the timing of budbreak before experiencing the effects of any environmental cue, is also phylogenetically patterned. This is, regardless the action of cues some tree species budbreak earlier than others, and these differences tend to be smaller, at least to some extent (the signal is weak $\lambda$ = 0.35), among closely related species. Previous work had already shown large variation across species in their model intercepts \citep{davies2013phylogenetic}. % not sure this is the right citation, ask Lizzie. This whole paragraph needs work (based on conversation over coffee May6th).  While fitted species-level intercepts did not change between the phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic model (\ref{fig:correls_angio}), our approach suggests that the mechanisms underlying species' baseline phenological differences would not operate randomly across the phylogeny.\\    

Phylogenetic hierarchical models such as those used here, have the potential to inform on which clades will be more sensitive to different axes of climate change---e.g., changes in cold temperatures over winter or in warm temperatures in spring and summer. For example, in standard non-phylogenetic models, we would not have identified oaks (genus \emph{Quercus}) as being among the most sensitive taxa to forcing and chilling (see e.g., \citep{ettinger2020}), but we show that species within this genus advance phenology by 2 days per standard unit of forcing and 4 days per standard unit of chilling. Ignoring phylogeny and species-level variation may (i) introduce bias into estimated model coefficients, (ii) underestimate true variability in species biological responses and, (iii) increase uncertainty around species-level estimates. Our integrative phylogenetic approach allows us to move beyond crude classifications based upon functional groups (e.g., !REFS) and species complexes (e.g. \cite{ettinger2020}), to make improved ecological forecasts for individual species. Our model, highlighting strong phylogenetic structure in species response, also highlights the potential for predicting phenological sensitivities in unmeasured species. While phylogenetic imputation must be done with extreme care \citep{molina2018assessing}, we can make predictions with reasonable accuracy for close relatives of well studied species when there is strong phylogenetic structure in species responses. Notably this is likely to be the case for many temperate woody plant clades, for which we have multiple experimental observations at varying treatment levels for well-known drivers of phenology.

Accurate forecasts of phenology remain elusive; recent records have suggested an apparent decline in species phenological sensitivity to increasing temperatures \citep{fu2015,piao2017}, but such observations may simply reflect non-linear responses to warming trends \citep{wolkovich2021simple}, perhaps reflecting the complex interactions, trade-offs and synergies among multiple cues. While all species appear sensitive to all cues, forcing and chilling dominating over photoperiod, and species-level variation in responses is large, of a magnitude similar to, or greater than, the difference in average effect sizes between cues. Phylogenetic conservatism in species phenology has been well documented \citep{davies2013phylogenetic,rafferty2017global,joly2019importance}, and may thus help explain species differences. Here, using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model, we allow for phylogenetic non-stationarity in species sensitivities (allowing slopes to vary across species; see \citep{davies2019phylogenetically}) to generate species-specific estimates of responses to shifting cues. Uniquely, our model additionally provides information on the evolutionary of species sensitivities, and how they may have been configured along evolutionary time. Our results are consistent with an early origin of photoperiod sensitivity, followed by a history of stabilizing selection. Forcing and chilling have evolved more rapidly. However, we caution that macroevolutionary rates provide a poor guide to future adaptive potential over short timescales, and accurate ecological forecasting requires well-designed experiments analysed appropriately.

{\bf Chunks that need to fit into the forecasting section ....}\\
Helpfully, the contrasts between temperature sensitivities and photoperiod sensitivities in both their variability across species and phylogenetic structuring allow for improved multi-species forecasts: (1) the large variability among species in temperature responses makes predicting species individual responses challenging, but the phylogenetic structure in responses lets us borrow  information from close relatives to improve our predictions; (2) the weak phylogenetic structure in photoperiod responses indicates that phylogeny retains little information, but because species responses are generally more uniform, we can be more confident in assuming the mean species response across species, comforted in the knowledge that small errors will likely not have large impact given the relatively weak overall contribution of this cue.

The genus \emph{Fagus} is recognized as being particularly sensitive to photoperiod \citep{fu2019}. Specifically, \emph{Fagus sylvatica} is nearly five times more sensitive to photoperiod than most other measured tree species. The question arises as to whether species with outlying responses should be chosen as the model from which to extrapolate knowledge as done with \emph{Fagus sylvatica} in the phenology literature (REFs for PEP75?!). \\%HELP with references on Fagus would be appreciated. % EMW (21Nov2022) I'll add more here later
%JD - this para needs a home ... perhaps when we talk about future for forecasting ...


%\subsection*{Model accuracy}
%IMCapr25 - I'd like to include a little subsection here on model accuracy, comparing R2s, LOO, or something similar for our models. Unfortunately, I can't find an easy way to do that (for stanfit objects: https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/best-way-to-do-prediction-on-new-data-r-rstan-stanfit/1772/17) any help with this is much appreciated. 
% EMW (26Apr2022): To use loo we just need a generated quantities block, right? If so I can try to help code that with Deirdre.
%IMCmay10- I re-run models storing yhats as a generated quantity, and with that computed a Bayes version of R2. There's not change in accuracy between our approach and the lambda0 approach, but accuracy drops if lambda is forced to be equal1.

%\item Do results differ from what would be expected if single cues where analyzed separately, phylo or non-phylogenetically?


%\item If so, can accounting for phylogeny shed light on the ongoing debate on declining sensitivities? For example, if particular lineages have very different evolutionary constraints on their responses to the cues, they may also display very differt declines in their sensitivities to the cues. % lizzie, I realize I missed important bits on the discussion we had on the relevance of this point, any pointers here are super welcome.

\begin{comment} % I'm pasting this bit from previous version of the intro in case we want to reuse some.
% \item most efforts are on the phenotype rather than on the magnitude of species phenological responsiveness to different environmental cues. 
% Could try to integrate this point above into above paragraph or include in below section that I have commented out ... I think the intro is likely long enough without the below and many of the points could fit in discussion, but up to you!
\iffalse
\item Focused on flowering (and leafout some) times and shifts in them (but see \cite{joly2019importance}, and add REFs!! on other phenological stages: budburst, ripening)
\item Studied trait correlation \citep{bolmgren2008time} (not a limitation, but a different focus)
\item Studied different evolutionary models best fitting the data \citep{rafferty2017global}
\item measured shifts based on field observation data for both climate and phenology (when slopes are available, they represent shifts with time, not shifts with the environment).
