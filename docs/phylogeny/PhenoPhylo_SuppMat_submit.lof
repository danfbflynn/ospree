The database used to fit the Phylogenetic Mixed Model comprised 44 studies, 191 species (all named in this version) and 2940 observations. The same phylogenetic tree is shown in each panel, colored according to an estimation of ancestral character states, being the states at the tips the species sensitivities to a cue, as estimated by our hierarchical phylogenetic model. Species sensitivities are shown as mean values $+/-$ 50\% uncertainty intervals. Note that the color scale varies in each panel. Total tree depth is 81 My.\relax }}{29}{figure.caption.10}%
