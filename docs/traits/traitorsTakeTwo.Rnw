% Request -- Fig 2 -- relabel with actual trait names on the x axis (and give units). Units on the y axis too please (standardized units). And please show ALL the traits we are talking about (mv from supp!) in one big figure. 

% Overall comments ... 
% I like the second section a lot and think you should consider starting with it. 
%DL: I moved section 2 up to begin the results

% I like section 3 a lot too ... I do think it would benefit from some early sentences saying something like: height and SLA showed the strongest responses and seed mass and LNC the weakest (or maybe that fits in section 2? I am not sure).
%DL: I added a sentence to section two on this

% I think you can cut section 1 for now, unless you can explain what it's doing. \
%DL: It doesn't do much, so I did cut it

% I like the sound of section 4 ... it has good stuff! I wonder if we could move it up ... results often start a little dry so a dry opener reminding folks of our cool models could work (you could also leave it last for now and consider later moving up). If you move it up then you can attack Fig 1 and Fig 3 together I think. Here's some draft text ... may be 1-2 paragraphs. 
%\iffalse 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our models jointly estimated species traits and phenological cues from large databases, while accounting for significant variation. 
\item For traits, our models suggest important study-level variation across traits. For most of our models, species level variation was greater than study level variation (\ref{supp - Table 3}, \ref{supp - Table 4}, \ref{supp - Table 5}). Our height model however, had greater study level variation than species level variation (\ref{supp - Table 2}). 

[you should compare the sigmas of studies versus species to give readers a sense of this], and provided estimates of species-level traits with lower uncertainty than simply using the raw data (Fig 3). 
%DL: 
\item For most (?) traits we estimated average trait values similar to averages from the raw data, but for some (examples? Maybe horse chestnut and height? Pick one with lots of data) these large study-level effects impacted species-level mean estimates. % not sure we need this...
\item We combined these trait-level estimates with estimates of forcing, chilling and photoperiod cues from a large meta-analysis of experiments where cues were generally independently manipulated (fig 1).  [We can work on updating the caption of fig 1 later to explain this more I think.]
\item Together this joint model produced estimates of how species-level traits may predict species-level phenological cues.
\end{enumerate}
%\fi

% The below would be a strong place to start ... why not start with this paragraph?
% DL: I like the idea of havinging figure 1 and 3 discussed in the same paragraph, so I am going to use your suggested text above and leave this second as the second section

\begin{enumerate}
\item Traits differed in whether they lead to greater advances and earlier budburst with increasing cues.
%\begin{enumerate}
\item Height and SLA showed the greatest responses to changes in cues level, while seed mass and LNC had the weakest
\item Taller species had extremely weak responses with forcing (\Sexpr{htBFSpMean} m per standardized forcing; \Sexpr{lower_htBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htBFSpMean}).
\item But as predicted, taller species had larger cue responses to chilling (\Sexpr{htBCSpMean} m per standardized chilling; 90\% uncertainty interval interval: \Sexpr{lower_htBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htBCSpMean})) and photoperiod (\Sexpr{htBPSpMean} m per standardized photoperiod; \Sexpr{lower_htBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htBPSpMean} for height. Though relationships with seed mass were extremely weak.
\item We did not find a relationship between seed mass and cue responses any of our three cues (\Sexpr{smBCSpMean} mg per standardized chilling; \Sexpr{lower_smBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_smBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{smBPSpMean} mg per standardized  photoperiod; \Sexpr{lower_smBPSpMean},  \Sexpr{upper_smBPSpMean}, (\Sexpr{smBFSpMean} mg per standardized forcing; \Sexpr{lower_smBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_smBFSpMean}))

% throw your audience and me a bone and remind me what SLA and LNC trend with (thinner leaves, higher nitrogen etc. -- go for words instead of acronyms in each section opener I think) ... again: weaker cues (not responses to cues)
\item Species that produced thin leaves, with a great surface area or less leaf mass and high specific leaf area had weaker forcing and chilling cues (\Sexpr{slaBFSpMean} mm\textsuperscript{2}/mg per standardized forcing; \Sexpr{lower_slaBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_slaBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{slaBCSpMean} mm\textsuperscript{2}/mg per standardized chilling; \Sexpr{lower_slaBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_slaBCSpMean}
\item but species with large SLA had stronger photoperiod cues (\Sexpr{slaBPSpMean} mm\textsuperscript{2}/mg per standardized photoperiod; \Sexpr{lower_slaBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_slaBPSpMean})
\item Species that produce leaves with high photosynthetic rates, and high leaf nitrogen contents as a result of having more photosynetheic machinery, showed weak trait responses. The relationship between LNC and forcing and chilling cues were weak, at \Sexpr{lncBFSpMean} mg/g per standardized forcing; \Sexpr{lower_lncBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBFSpMean}) and (\Sexpr{lncBCSpMean} mg/g per standardized; \Sexpr{lower_lncBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBCSpMean}, and \Sexpr{lncBPSpMean} mg/g per standardized photoperiod; \Sexpr{lower_lncBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBPSpMean} for each cue respectively
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For traits, our models suggest important study-level variation across traits ... [you should compare the sigmas of studies versus species to give readers a sense of this], and provided estimates of species-level traits with lower uncertainty than simply using the raw data (Fig 3). \ref{figure:TraitDistributions}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item allows us to better account for differences in tree age, timing of sampling, local adaptation, or human error
\item see a lot of variation in height data, which is our most commonly measured trait with measurements from 22 %double check this
studies
\item Seed mass comes from five studies and is least variable

    \caption{Comparisons of estimated cue responses of a species with an trait value associated with acquisitive growth strategies, shown in green, or conservative growth strategies, shown in purple. Associations between seed mass and forcing, chilling, and photoperiod are depicted on panels a to c and associations between LNC and each cue in panel d to f. The green points represent the budburst data for \textit{Populus tremula}, a relatively small seeded species, while the green points are budburst data of the large seeded species, \textit{Aesculus hippocastanum}. Dark bands represent the 50\% credible interval for the posterior cue estimates for the full model. Opaque bands represent the 50\% credible interval for the posterior cue estimates with a trait effect of zero. The negative value of the seed mass model's slope for each cue produces a more negative effect on the day of budburst when seed mass is included in the model. This suggests that trees that produce large seeds advance their budburst dates at a higher rate to increasing cues (a-c). The effect of seed mass however, is relatively small compared to that observed from other traits. Estimates of the cue responses in our LNC model were all positive and produced more positive slopes in the full model. This indicates that high SLA values are less responsive in their budburst to increasing forcing, chilling, and photoperiod values (d to f). The greater effect of slopes on taller trees and high SLA species is a artifact of the trait value itself being larger and not a reflection on the magnitidue of the response.}

    
    % a smaller advance in budburst with increasing forcing when height effects were included % I don't fully understand this previous or the next sentence -- it reads as though we're contrasting (do we have models without height we plan to report?) ... wait, wait, I get it! You're talking about the counterfactual shown in Fig 1. I think we just keep this in a caption?s

\section{Discussion}

% Scrape

%\item Functional traits did influence the variation in the timing of budburst date in response to forcing, chilling, and photoperiod cues across species
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item but varied by trait and species whether responses in cue slopes followed the predicted gradients in trait values
%\item strongest effects for chilling 
%\item weakest effects observed for photoperiod
%\end{enumerate}
%\item The strength of species cue responses were associated with species trait values: referencing Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits}
