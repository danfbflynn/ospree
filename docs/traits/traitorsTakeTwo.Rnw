Species phenologies---the timing of recurring life history events---can vary substantially with environmental variation. While climate change has triggered shifts in phenology and changed proximate drivers like temperature, the ultimate drivers of species-level variation are still poorly understood. In temperate forests, phenological variation across species may be driven by trade-offs between early season conditions, when the risk of tissue loss is high but resources abundant, and the more benign late season conditions, when competition is greater. This idea fits within fundamental theories of plant growth strategies and infers suites of traits that may co-vary with phenologies. But testing the role of phenology within a functional trait framework is challenging given its variability across environments. Here, we use a meta-analysis of controlled environment experiments to overcome this challenge and pair it with plant trait data from major databases. We found height, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) to have strong relationships with cue responses and budburst, but not always in the direction predicted. The conservative phenotype of tall trees with low LNC both showed the strongest responses to chilling and photoperiod and impacts on phenology. Cues, however, varied in their relationship to SLA, with low SLA species responding to forcing as predicted, but not photoperiod. Our findings demonstrate important relationships between phenological cues and broader trait phenotypes, showing that leafout phenology generally fits within a functional trait framework of acquisitive to conservative growth strategies. By better understanding these broader trait relationships, we can predict the ultimate drivers shaping species phenotypes and their influence on community dynamics. \\

Key Words: Budburst phenology, functional traits, Trees, climate change 

\section*{Introduction} 

The timing of life history events---phenology---can shape both ecosystem services and community dynamics. Spring phenology, for example, defines the start and overall length of the growing season---shaping forest carbon storage and species interactions \citep{Cleland2007a,Beard2019,Gu2022}. As climate change has caused spring growth to advance in many systems \citep{Menzel2006,Vitasse2021}, there is growing concern over how these changes may impact communities and ecosystems.
\\

Predicting these changes requires understanding the drivers of phenology both at a proximate scale---the environmental triggers of phenology, such as temperature and daylength---and at a more ultimate scale, of how timing may assemble species within a community \citep{Ovaskainen2013,Wolkovich2021}. At the proximate level, changing environmental conditions across the winter and spring cause species to start growth at different times. This has been especially well documented for the start of growth in woody plants each year \citep{Laube2014b,Flynn2018}, with similar trends  observed for spring phenological events across taxa, including in the timing of egg laying in birds \citep{Crick1997,DAlba2010} and the advance of spawning in amphibians \citep{Tryjanowski2003,Kusano2008}. But this work has provided limited insights into the drivers of species differences \citep{Laube2014b,Chuine2016,Flynn2018}. 
\\

At the ultimate level, our predictions for why phenologies vary generally stem from our understanding of how selective pressures change as the early season progresses. Species that start growth early often risk high tissue loss---due to frost damage \citep{Sakai1987,Augspurger2009} or high herbivore apparency \citep{Wainwright2012}---but benefit from higher resource availability \citep{Rathcke1985a,Hufkens2012}. In contrast, later species face greater biotic pressures, especially from high competition for resources  \citep{Lopez2008,Wolkovich2014}.
% Wainwright: Seasonal priority effects: implications for invasion and 6 restoration in a semi-arid system.
\\

Differences in the timing of selective pressures within the growing season could shape a number of species attributes. Species with earlier growth may produce cheaper tissues that can be more easily replaced if damaged \citep{Reich1999}. But later species would benefit from investing in tissues that infer greater resource acquisition and retention \citep{Gorne2020}. These differences in traits, and trade-offs in allocation of resources to growth and tissue quality can be related to a broader framework of species growth strategies and functional traits \citep{Wolkovich2014}.
\\

In plants, several well studied traits have been identified as species-level proxies for varying growth strategies and responses to biotic interactions \citep{McGill2006}. These leaf and wood traits follow gradients in their trait values, having associations that range from acquisitive (fast) growth strategies to more conservative (slow) growth strategies \citep{Westoby1998,Westoby2006,Wright2004,Diaz2016}. Collectively, these trait relationships led to the development of the leaf economic spectrum and the wood economic spectrum \citep{Wright2004,Chave2009}. 
\\

These functional trait spectra---or frameworks---have been built into decades of research linking functional traits with how species respond to abiotic and biotic factors and community assembly \citep{Kraft2010,Paine2011,HilleRisLambers2012,Luo2019}, but have limitations. These frameworks often fail to predict how variable traits are \citep{Violle2012}, a reason sometimes given for why phenology is excluded from studies of functional traits. However, we argue that including phenology---and its high variability---alongside other functional traits could advance the functional trait framework and help explain why species phenologies differ. 
\\

Spring phenology in temperate forests may provide the best opportunity to integrate phenology into functional trait research, especially considering the strong gradients in selective environments that occur early versus later in the spring.  As in other systems, early season species trade-off high access to resources (greater soil resources and light availability) with risks of tissue loss and damage, while late season species experience a highly competitive but less risky environment. Based on these trade-offs, we predict that shrub and woody understory species, many of which budburst before canopy closure \citep{Donnelly2019}, would have traits associated with acquisitive growth; they thus would be shorter, with leaf traits favourable to higher light availability and tolerance of late spring frost (high specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC)).  %low forcing, chilling, and photoperiod 
Canopy species that budburst later---when competition for soil resources is greatest---would have traits associated with conservative growth; being taller with denser wood \citep{Laughlin2010}, with leaf traits suited for more variable light (low SLA and LNC). % high forcing, chilling, and photoperiod requirements % early-late
Seed size may similarly be predicted from this acquisitive to conservative continuum, as acquisitive species produce smaller seeds that germinate quickly and conservative species produce larger, better provisioned, seeds.  %Dec20emw -- explain last point about seed size more. Something like: Increasing seed size may similarly be predicted from this acquisitive to conservative continuum from early to late budbursting species: early species may thus have smaller/larger seeds because ... while later species have smaller/larger seeds.---Done
\\

Testing these predictions requires a reliable way to define early to late phenology, as phenology varies strongly across sites and years. The underlying cues that predict gradients in phenology, however, do not vary strongly across space and time \citep{Chuine1999,Harrington2015,Flynn2018}. Early species generally have weak (small in magnitude) responses to all three major cues of spring leafout: warm spring temperatures (forcing), cool winter temperatures (chilling) and daylength (photoperiod). In contrast, later species have stronger (larger) responses to chilling and/or photoperiod, and likely higher forcing as well \citep{Laube2014b,Flynn2018}. 
\\

To test these predictions of associations between budburst responses to environmental cues and common functional traits, we merged available data from trait databases (BIEN and TRY) with budburst data from the OSPREE database of controlled environment studies. We focus on woody species, initially considering six traits---SLA, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), height, seed mass, stem specific density (SSD), and LNC. We further removed SSD and LMDC from our focal traits, as they correlated strongly with height and SLA respectively (see supplementary material). \\
% EMWJune4 -- I think we could include ALL our traits here, then discuss the PCA perhaps and how we narrowed them down in the methods? Or where will that go (supp)? Good to include that work somehow as it was a lot of work, and will head off reviewers asking about why these traits. We could add here after 'four commonly measured traits' -- 'four commonly measured traits (that correlate strongly with XX other traits, see supp)' or such. 

%Dec20emw -- some edits below, still needs some tweaking
%dlDec28---added more tweaks
To better understand the relationships between phenology and other traits, we combined this novel and encompassing trait-phenology dataset with a hierarchical Bayesian joint model. This analytical approach allows us to predict phenological responses to cues based on species-level trait values, while allowing additional variation due to species. This approach thus takes a step towards predicting variation via species traits instead of species identity. When traits explain a significant portion of the variation, species will explain only a small amount, which would allow us to use trait values to predict species growth strategies and phenological responses, while providing new insights into the effects of traits on phenological cue. \\

@

For our analysis we used phenological data from the OSPREE database \citep{Ettinger2020}. The OSPREE database contains phenological data for woody, deciduous species from experiments of phenological cues. We updated the database since its initial publication, for details on the methods used see Morales \emph{et al.}\cite{Morales2024}. \\

Trait data was obtained from TRY and BIEN---two large trait databases compiling plant trait data across many individuals, species, and studies. We obtained data from both databases on 5 December, 2018, with an updated version of the TRY data obtained 10 April, 2019. We focused our search for trait data on the subset of 234 OSPREE species used in \citet{Morales2024}, which represents well studied species with good phenology and phylogenetic data. Using the BIEN R package \citep{Maitner2018}, we downloaded trait data for the 94 available species for 13 traits. The TRY database included 96 of our focal species with ten functional traits \citep{tryDB}. Only trait data from adult individuals with a minimum height of 1.42 m was included in our analyses and we removed all data from experiments or from plants growing in non-natural habitats. We also grouped trait values where appropriate, for example categorizing trait values for SLA, SLA  with petioles, and SLA without petioles as simply SLA in our analysis (Table S\ref{tableDataSources}). Duplicated data in both the TRY and BIEN datasets were also removed ($n$ = 434905). \\

%Dec20emw -- I think something more like a topic sentence/overview would be good here so I tried to edit for that, but needs a little work.

%dlDec28: I was once told it was good form to write out abbreviations in each section, as I have done below, but perhaps this is antiquated advice
For our analysis, we aimed to only include species for which we had a complete trait profile, subsetting the phenology and trait data to include only species for which we had at least one measurement for each trait. We used a PCA to understand trait correlations and adjusted which traits we included. A PCA of our six initial traits identified high correlations between SLA and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and between height and stem specific density (SSD) (see Supplementary material). In this analysis, the principal component explained \Sexpr{pca1}\% of variation while the second explained \Sexpr{pca2}\% of the variation (Fig. S\ref{figure:pca}). By excluding one trait from each of these pairs (specifically LDMC and SSD) we increased the number of species in our dataset from the 26 species with six traits, to 37 species for which we had complete datasets for four traits. The data for these 37 species was from \Sexpr{nStudy} unique studies (height $n$ = \Sexpr{nHt}, seed mass $n$ = \Sexpr{nSM}, LNC $n$ = \Sexpr{nLNC}, SLA $n$ = \Sexpr{nSLA}). We subsampled height measurements to reduce the influence the 13 most frequently measured tree species had on our height model (discussed below). These species were measured on average \Sexpr{htMany} times more frequently than other species in our dataset and therefore we randomly sampled 3000 height measurements for each of these species.
\\ 

% Finally, we subsetted the data to include only species for which we had a complete dataset for each species and trait, which resulted in a dataset of only 26 species and six functional traits. After performing a PCA, we further refined our trait selection, and only included traits that did not show strong correlations. In this analysis, the principal component explained \Sexpr{pca1}\% of variation while the second explained \Sexpr{pca2}\% of the variation (Fig. \ref{supp- figure:pca}). Due to strong association between specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and between stem specific density (SSD) and height, we reduced the number of traits in our analysis to include only height, seed mass, LNC, and SLA. By including only these four traits, we were able to increase the number of species with at least one trait measurement per trait to 37 species with data from \Sexpr{nStudy} studies (height n = \Sexpr{nHt}, seed mass n = \Sexpr{nSM}, LNC n = \Sexpr{nLNC}, SLA n = \Sexpr{nSLA}). Given the abundance of height data and overrepresentation of height measurements for six of our focal species, we randomly sampled 3000 height measurements for each of these species to include in our analysis. This was done to reduce the effect of trait values from these frequently measured species from overwhelming the partial pooling effect in our model.\\ 

\subsection*{Joint model of trait and phenology}
To understand connections between phenology and other species traits, we built a joint model for each trait (height, SLA, LNC, and seed mass) with the major phenological cues (forcing, chilling, and photoperiod) to predict day of year of budburst. This allowed us to jointly estimate species trait effects and responses to phenological cues in one model, carrying through all uncertainty across varying datasets and approaches (e.g. comparing across the \emph{in situ} observational trait data in the TRY and BIEN databases and the experimental plant phenology data of the OSPREE database). As phenological cues are the most proximate drivers of variation in budburst, and appear to represent different strategies along a continuum from acquisitive to conservative, our model allows traits to influence each cue separately (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits}). \\

The joint model includes a hierarchical linear model to partition variation for individual observations (\emph{i}) of a given trait value ($y_{\text{trait}[i]}$) to the effects of species (\emph{sp id}), study (\emph{study id}), and residual variation ($\sigma_{\text{trait}}$, also called `measurement error').
% General on eqns: Gelman and Hill discusses how to write equations starting on page 262, with some good alternatives. I like to use words instead of letters for indexing when possible (so `sp' and `study' below) and i is often used for the observation-level in statistics, so should not be used otherwise. 
% There could be a couple things off about this equation (that we can hopefully catch and fix) but I think it works mostly. 
% The previous draft of equations seemed to use some cool labeling techniques for equations; it would be great to add these back in, especially if we plan to reference eqn numbers (maybe less necessary if not). 
% Ailene likes to order cues by the temporal order that they effect plants (chilling, forcing, photoperiod) -- given that we seem to find this is also the order of effect size across cues I think it seems reasonable, and I have tried to implement it. But I probably messed it up some places (and if you like this we should follow it throughout the text). 
\begin{align}
\mu_{trait} & = \alpha_{\text{grand trait}} + \alpha_{\text{sp[sp id]}} + \alpha_{\text{study[study id]}}\\
\alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp id]}} &  \sim normal(0, \sigma_{\alpha_{\text{sp}}}) \nonumber \\
\alpha_{\text{study[study id]}} & \sim normal(0,\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{study}}}) \nonumber \\
y_{\text{trait}[i]} & \sim normal( \mu_{trait}, \sigma_{\text{trait}}) \nonumber 
\end{align}
It estimates a separate value for each species ($\alpha_{\text{sp[sp id]}}$), and study ($\alpha_{\text{study[study id]}}$), while partially pooling across species and studies to yield overall estimates of variance across each ($\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{sp}}}$ and $\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{study}}}$, respectively). This partial pooling (often called `random effects') controls for variation in sample size and variability to yield more accurate estimates for each species. \\

These species-level estimates of traits ($\alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp id]}}$) were then used as predictors of species-level estimates of each phenological cue ($\beta_{\text{force[sp]}}$, $\beta_{\text{chill[sp]}}$, $\beta_{\text{photo[sp]}}$) 
\begin{align}
\beta_{\text{chill[sp]}} & = \alpha_{\text{chill}[sp]} + \beta_{\text{trait}.\text{chill}} \times \alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp]}} \nonumber \\
\beta_{\text{force[sp]}} & = \alpha_{\text{force}[sp]} + \beta_{\text{trait}.\text{force}} \times \alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp]}} \\
\beta_{\text{photo[sp]}} & = \alpha_{\text{photo}[sp]} + \beta_{\text{trait}.\text{photo}} \times \alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp]}} \nonumber 
\end{align}

This model allows an overall effect of each trait---estimated across species---on each phenological cue ($\beta_{\text{trait}.\text{chill}}$, $\beta_{\text{trait}.\text{force}}$, $\beta_{\text{trait}.\text{photo}}$), while also allowing for species-level variation in cues that is not explained by traits ($\alpha_{\text{chill}[sp]} $, $\alpha_{\text{force}[sp]}$, $\alpha_{\text{photo}[sp]}$); this importantly means that variation across species is not forced onto the trait effect. Thus the model tests the power of traits to predict species-level differences.\\

Days to budburst ($y_{\text{pheno[i]}}$) is then predicted by the phenological cues and variation across experiments in chilling, forcing and photoperiod levels ($C_i$, $F_i$, $P_i$, respectively, which we $z$-scored to allow direct comparison of cues), with residual variation allowed across species ($\alpha_{\text{pheno[sp]}}$) and observations ($\sigma_{\text{pheno}}$):
\begin{align}
\mu_{pheno} & = \alpha_{\text{pheno[sp]}}+ \beta_{\text{chill[sp]}} \times C_i + \beta_{\text{force[sp]}}\times F_i + \beta_{\text{photo[sp]}} \times P_i\\
y_{\text{pheno[i]}} & \sim normal( \mu_{pheno}, \sigma_{\text{pheno}}) \nonumber 
\end{align}
The model includes partial pooling for residual variation in days to budburst across species and variation in each phenological cue not attributed to the trait:
\begin{align}
\alpha_{\text{pheno}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{pheno}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{pheno}}}) \\
\alpha_{\text{force}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{force}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{force}}}) \nonumber \\
\alpha_{\text{chill}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{chill}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{chill}}}) \nonumber \\
\alpha_{\text{photo}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{photo}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{photo}}}) \nonumber
\end{align}

We chose weakly informative priors, and validated them using a series of prior predictive checks. The model was coded in the Stan programming language, fit using the rstan package \citep{rstan2018}, with 1,000 iterations per chain across 4 chain (4,000 total sampling iterations), and all models met basic diagnostic checks, including no divergences, high effective sample size (\textit{n\_eff}), and $\hat{R}$ close to 1.

Our approach used models that jointly estimated species traits and phenological cues to understand the possible connections between phenology, with a focus on days to budburst and other plant traits. Since our trait data was from large trait databases, which combine data across many studies, our analysis partitioned the trait variation due to species from the study-level effects. Then using the species-level estimates of traits (i.e. species-level estimates with effects of study removed), we examined how traits predicted phenological cues and budburst, while allowing for residual variation in cues to be explained by a species effect.\\

Across our models, we found species-level variation across traits was comparable with or greater than variation across study. Variation across studies was greatest for height (\Sexpr{htSigmaStudy} m compared to \Sexpr{htSigmaSp} m species-level variation, Fig. \ref{fig:sigmaDensities}). For seed mass and LNC study-level variation was less than that of the species-level variation (seed mass study-level variation: \Sexpr{seedSigmaStudy} mg; versus species-level variation: \Sexpr{seedSigmaSp} mg; LNC study-level variation \Sexpr{lncSigmaStudy} mg g\textsuperscript{-1} versus species-level variation: \Sexpr{lncSigmaSp} mg g\textsuperscript{-1}; Fig. \ref{fig:sigmaDensities}). At the lowest end, study-level variation in SLA was approximately half the value of the species-level variation (and \Sexpr{slaSigmaStudy} mm\textsuperscript{2} mg\textsuperscript{-1} versus \Sexpr{slaSigmaSp} mm\textsuperscript{2} mg\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively). The magnitude of study-level variation we observed suggests that models using large trait databases that fail to separate out study from species-level variation may poorly estimate species' traits.\\

We combined the species-level trait estimates with data on forcing, chilling and photoperiod values from the OSPREE database of phenological experiments  in order to test if traits (height, SLA, seed mass, LNC) related to phenological cues and species budburst dates (Fig. \ref{fig:slopes}). For some traits we found much of the variation in phenological cues across species could be explained by trait variation (see panel a-f and j-l in Fig \ref{fig:cuetraits}), while other traits were weak predictors (see g-i in Fig \ref{fig:cuetraits}).\\

Across traits, height, SLA, and LNC strongly predicted responses to different cue-levels (forcing, chilling, and photoperiod), with a consistent direction of responses across cues for only LNC and not height or SLA (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits} a-f and j-l). Seed mass had the weakest responses, with no considerable relationship between seed mass and cues across the three cues (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits} g-i). \\

%Dec20emw -- adjusted height x forcing phrasing 
Height was not related to forcing %(\Sexpr{htBFSpMean} m per standardized forcing; 90\% uncertainty interval (UI): \Sexpr{lower_htBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htBFSpMean})
, but was related to chilling and photoperiod. As we predicted, taller species had larger responses to chilling (\Sexpr{htBCSpMean} m per standardized chilling; 90\% uncertainty interval (UI): \Sexpr{lower_htBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htBCSpMean}) and photoperiod (\Sexpr{htBPSpMean} m per standardized photoperiod; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_htBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htBPSpMean}), both of which are cues that would generally lead to later budburst and fit within an overall conservative growth strategy. \\

Species SLA did not strongly predict responses to chilling or forcing (Fig. \ref{fig:slopes} b and d). %(\Sexpr{slaBCSpMean} mm\textsuperscript{2}/mg per standardized chilling; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_slaBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_slaBCSpMean}, Fig. \ref{fig:slopes} b). 
But, SLA did relate to photoperiod (\Sexpr{slaBPSpMean} mm\textsuperscript{2}/mg per standardized photoperiod; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_slaBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_slaBPSpMean}). Thus, species with more acquisitive growth strategies (thin leaves and a lower investment in leaf mass that leads to high SLA values), had larger responses to photoperiod cues, contrary to our predictions.\\ %In line with our predictions, species with high SLA values (acquisitive strategy) had a smaller response to forcing cues (\Sexpr{slaBFSpMean} mm\textsuperscript{2}/mg per standardized forcing; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_slaBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_slaBFSpMean}), with low SLA species being more responsive to forcing  (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits} d).\\

For LNC, we found that species that produce leaves with high nitrogen content, which relates generally to high photosynthetic rates and acquisitive growth, were less responsive to cues (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits} j-i). These findings are in line with our predictions that high LNC species (acquisitive) would be less responsive to chilling (\Sexpr{lncBCSpMean} mg/g per standardized chilling; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_lncBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBCSpMean}), with similar responses to photoperiod (\Sexpr{lncBPSpMean} mg/g per standardized photoperiod; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_lncBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBPSpMean}) and to forcing cues (\Sexpr{lncBFSpMean} mg/g per standardized forcing; 90\% UI: \Sexpr{lower_lncBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBFSpMean}). \\

%Of our four traits, seed mass had the weakest responses across the three cues (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits} g-i). While the direction of the species responses were in line without predictions, we did not find a considerable relationship between seed mass and cues. % for forcing (\Sexpr{smBFSpMean} mg per standardized forcing; \Sexpr{lower_smBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_smBFSpMean}) or photoperiod or chilling (\Sexpr{smBCSpMean} mg per standardized chilling; \Sexpr{lower_smBCSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_smBCSpMean}). \Sexpr{smBPSpMean} mg per standardized  photoperiod; \Sexpr{lower_smBPSpMean},  \Sexpr{upper_smBPSpMean}).\\ %Dec20emw -- something weird in the Sweave #s in last sentence here -- check the PDF

\section*{Discussion}

Species traits influenced the timing of budburst in response to three primary cues for spring phenology (chilling, forcing and photoperiod). Whether these trait effects led to earlier or later phenology was correlated with well known gradients in traits, from acquisitive to conservative growth strategies. We found the greatest budburst responses for traits related to resource acquisition and structure, with SLA, LNC, and height all depicting strong responses across our three cues. In contrast, our one reproductive trait---seed mass---showed a weak response. Despite finding these general trends in trait relationships to phenology, we also found considerable variation across studies, often at a magnitude comparable to the differences observed across species.\\

Our study is one of the first to jointly model budburst cues and timing with other trait relationships. Using this approach we identified trends in phenological cues based on species-level trait variation, while accounting for the high degree of uncertainty that arises when combining datasets of diverse communities. While data limitations meant that we could only include a small number of species, our dataset represents the most comprehensive trait syndrome available, making it an important first step to identify general trends that scale across populations and species. Our study addresses the complex interactions between traits and cues shaping species temporal niche, and contributes to a more holistic approach to better forecast future changes in species temporal niche and phenotypes.\\ %, while having potential applications for the individual level data needed to best forecast future changes in species temporal niche.
%But to further improve our predictive abilities will require data from finer scales, requiring trait and phenological data at the individual level. 

%Dec20emw -- do we need a section on what our results mean for phenology as part of the functional trait framework and/or something on dividing up phenological traits into cues? It jumps now into deep specifics on what this means for *forests* so feel appropriate to a forest journal. I think you could move up some of the below section to here, but make it BROADER in its focus, then have a section or paragraph later on what this means for forests ... 
Gradients in phenology generally followed similar gradients in traits we associate with fast growing, acquisitive species to conservative, slower growth strategies. Phenologically earlier species had traits that inferred faster return on resource investments \citep{Grime1977,Westoby1998,Chave2009}. In contrast, phenologically late species filled different trait space (Fig. \ref{fig:cuetraits}), exhibiting a phenotype that infers greater competitive abilities and slower growth \citep{Grime1977,Westoby1998,Chave2009}. Our findings suggest the assembly of communities results from varying selective pressures, such as strong abiotic filters early in the growing season, and greater biotic pressures later in the season. By including phenology in the trait framework, we can identify the interactions across traits and cues and tease apart the underlying mechanisms shaping species' temporal niche across communities. \\%Oct31 -- cool, big this up and be sure to consider for cover letter/abstract

\subsection*{Effects of phenology-trait relationships on community assembly} %Dec20emw -- rename subheader to be more specific to this section (otherwise sounds like the whole paper topic), maybe 'What trait x phenology correlations mean for forest assembly' or something? Or maybe merge with next section on forecasting?

In our study of temperature forest communities, the relationships between budburst phenology and other plant traits provided insights into the mechanisms that shape species phenotypes. Earlier budbursting species had traits, such as shorter heights and low LNC, that allow them to grow quickly and benefit from greater light availability in the open canopy of many early-spring temperate forests. This phenotype can be linked to other ecological processes and species characteristics, such as species successional position, as illustrated by the differences between early successional species, like \emph{Alnus incana}, and later successional species, like \emph{Quercus ilex} (Fig \ref{fig:cuetraits}). Our results may also be useful to help predict communities' potential for invasion, as communities with similar phenologies and general trait syndromes, appear more susceptible to fast growing, non-native species \citep{Wolkovich2011,Alexander2019,Schuster2021}. In identifying the trait syndromes of native forest communities and the interactions between traits and environmental cues, we can better predict and mitigate the challenges forest communities face with climate change.\\

The traits with cue responses that deviated from our expectations also offer novel insights into the tradeoffs between traits and environmental cues. All of our traits are associated with numerous aspects of species growth, and may be adaptive for reasons other than those we predicted. Contrary to our predictions, we found strong forcing cues for short trees, which could prevent frost damage or xylem cavitation under a false spring \citep{Clements1972,Marquis2020} and influence annual cambial meristem growth \citep{Lenz2016}. Similarly, the lack of chilling or forcing responses by high SLA individuals' could be driven by other trait attributes and environmental cues---selecting for species relative growth rates or leaf longevity---and not photosynthetic potential \citep{Westoby1998,Reich2014}. These findings highlight the complexity of determining the drivers of species trait profiles, offering novel insights into how traits affect community dynamics under variable environments.\\

\subsection*{Phenology-trait relationships under future climates}

Incorporating phenology within broader trait syndromes is necessary to accurately predict species responses to climate change. Recent phenological shifts are well documented, but there remains a high degree of unexplained variation across species and populations \citep{Vitasse2009,Wolkovich2014,Zohner2014,Vitasse2018}. Our findings demonstrate that the same environmental cues driving phenological traits also relate to leaf and structural traits and thus suggest that warming that favors species with certain phenological cues, can favor specific trait syndromes. \\%, potentially impacting species overall fitness and coexistence. 

%Dec20emw -- you have a cool point here! I think it gets to my question above about cues x traits, but you need to slow down and explain more for readers to get it.  For example:
% In temperate forests, warming temperatures could favour species with acquisitive growth strategies, as they are less limited by chilling and photoperiod requirements and possess traits that infer faster growth and resource acquisition
% should probably be more like:
% In temperate forests, warming may favor species without strong chilling and photoperiod requirements, as these requirements may cause phenology to shift less with warming. Our results suggest that these cue requirements co-vary  with acquisitive growth strategies. Thus, future forests may be dominated by species with lower chill and photoperiod requirements and species with traits that allow them to faster growth and rapidly acquire resources ...
% But you should may contrast what all this means when you layer on other climate effects, like drought -- if warming favors early-active acquisitive species, it may also favor those that do poorly under low resource (such as drought) conditions. So all this could be another paragraph or two ... 
In temperate forests, warming may favor species with weak chilling and photoperiod requirements, as these requirements may allow phenology to shift more with warming. Our results suggest that these low cue requirements co-vary  with acquisitive growth strategies. Thus, future forests may be dominated by species with lower chill and photoperiod cues and with traits that allow them to grow faster and rapidly acquire resources. In contrast, conservative species with high chilling and photoperiod requirements, could face greater abiotic stressors. Rising winter temperatures could result in insufficient chilling, while strong photoperiod cues could limit species ability to also advance in response to warmer spring conditions \citep{Guy2014}. Species that are less able to advance phenologically might experience more competition \citep{Carter2018,Alexander2019}, as priority effects allow species that begin growth earlier in the season to deplete resources. Growing under warmer summer conditions could also result in greater drought stress \citep{Frelich2010}. In addition to altering the distribution of species temporal niches within a season, species trait syndromes have the potential to define the environmental conditions under which growth occurs.\\

%Dec20emw -- not sure this fits, see what you think. If you like it, we can leave for now and see what co-authors think.
%dlDec28 I agree it feels tacked on, so I am cutting it---but I moved small snippits to the forest specific paragraph above

% The cascading impacts of plant trait syndromes and temporal niche can determine the species composition and vulnerability of forest communities to invasions. Invasive species are known for their greater phenological plasticity and responses to seasonal variation \citp{Wilsey2011,Fridley2012}. These species can possess the same traits that allow native species to track warming temperatures. But the potential for invasive species to fill vacant niche early within a season allow them to benefit from priority effects, and compete more with native species for resources \citep{Wolkovich2011,Alexander2019}. %In characterizing the trait syndromes of native forest communities, we can use existing trait data to predict species responses to climate change and vulnerability of communities to invasion. 
% Communities with high trait diversity will be more resistant to invasion, while communities with similar phenologies and general trait syndromes are more likely to be invaded \citep{Schuster2021}. In characterizing the trait syndromes of native forest communities, we can better predict the challenges they face with climate change and mitigate future impacts.

A delay in day of budburst due to trait effects was found for both SLA and LNC in response to forcing and chilling cues and for LNC in response to photoperiod cues (panel d, e, g, h, and i). Only in response to photoperiod does the effect of SLA lead to stronger phenological responses and slightly earlier budburst with longer photoperiods.

%Dec20emw --- we never talk about 'negative' and 'positive' in the ms the way we do above, which is good! As the above is confusing (I really don't get it). I think we'd be better off just using an example if we cannot come up with better words. Also, skip 'cue responses' throughout ms. 
%dlDec28: tried rewording it, hopefully it is clearer

%EMW19Oct2022: I think this figure has much to offer, but still does not connect to the text much ... So I was thinking we try to make this figure tie better to the hypotheses or methods -- if it connected to the methods it would be with the model and I do currently cite it there. But I think it might be better with the intro and predictions. Could we possibly reference a-c at all in the intro with predictions? And then we REALLY need to slim the caption text and explain it a little better there.
% So, some quick thoughts -- we probably have to cut stuff that is hard to interpret, such as 'Comparisons of estimated cue responses of a representative species with a trait value associated with acquisitive growth strategies, shown in green, or conservative growth strategies, shown in purple.' or 'represent a conceptual framework for interpreting trait responses.' -- this adds too many words without enough meaning. 
% So then we would replace with something that launches into the ideas of the intro. Maybe call it 'How functional traits may impact phenological cues.' And again, give some examples from predictions (perhaps the ones that show up in d-i). So:
% "a) If species with traits associated with conservative (shown in dark purple) and acquisitive growth (shown in darker green) have stronger cue responses and greater advances in budburst date with increasing environmental cues, this will produce a steeper response (or slope) of the full model in comparison to the cue only (trait effect = 0) model. Furthermore, species with acquisitive traits are predicted to budburst earlier than species with more conservative traits."
% could become something like:
% We predict  a) some traits associated with conservative (e.g. high LNC or something) and acquisitive growth will lead to advances in day of budburst (y axis) due to stronger responses to environmental cues (x axis), while b) other traits may have no relationship (e.g., XX) and c) .... [This is much shorter and clearer.]
% And maybe something that explains next the models and defines the colors etc.
% I am still not sure the conceptual figure is correct -- can the green ever be above the purple the way it is in (c)? I might suggest you write out what you want to show then draw the lines that actually go with it.... I will also post these notes on issue #444

Associations between seed mass and forcing, chilling, and photoperiod are depicted on panels a to c and associations between LNC and each cue in panel d to f. The green points represent the budburst data for \textit{Populus tremula}, a relatively small seeded species, while the green points are budburst data of the large seeded species, \textit{Aesculus hippocastanum}. Dark bands represent the 50\% credible interval for the posterior cue estimates for the full model. Opaque bands represent the 50\% credible interval for the posterior cue estimates with a trait effect of zero. The negative value of the seed mass model's slope for each cue produces a more negative effect on the day of budburst when seed mass is included in the model. This suggests that trees that produce large seeds advance their budburst dates at a higher rate to increasing cues (a-c). The effect of seed mass however, is relatively small compared to that observed from other traits. Estimates of the cue responses in our LNC model were all positive and produced more positive slopes in the full model. This indicates that high SLA values are less responsive in their budburst to increasing forcing, chilling, and photoperiod values (d to f). The greater effect of slopes on taller trees and high SLA species is a artifact of the trait value itself being larger and not a reflection on the magnitude of the response.}
