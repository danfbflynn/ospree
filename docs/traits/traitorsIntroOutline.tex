\title{Global asynchrony across clades, not trophic levels explain shifts in species phenologies}

\maketitle 

BROAD outline ...

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open with phenological diversity (lots of it across spp. most of it unexplained, cite Laube, Flynn etc. work)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Spp temporal niche are changing w/ clim change — changes ecological communities/spp interactions
\item Spp responses to changes in temp are highly variable, reflecting species specific responses to abiotic cues and the interactive nature of cues - Flynn, Laude
\item But still have a limited mechanistic understanding of how specific spp will respond
\end{enumerate}

\item Set up early vs. late phenology and frost versus competition (could maybe mention invaders within this)? Try to basically set up the idea of traits, without saying traits.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The timing of bb in woody spp appear to range from early spring species — bb prior to canopy closure — and later canopy spp. 
\item Previous studies have shown 3 cues are most important for spp responses - forcing, chilling, photoperiod
\item Early in the spring = greater risk of false spring events and frost = greater abiotic risks to early bud bursting spp and potential loss of tissue
\item Late spp = less light available and competition for resources = more biotic pressures
\item Differences in bb phenology within communities = important in shaping community dynamics including competition \& herbivory. 
\item But also the potential invasibility of a community, invasive spp tend to be early bb with the potential to fill vacant niche space early in the season. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Now get to phenology (as day of year/early-late) x traits and how that connects to 2.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Considerable work on the functional traits related to species growth strategies and competitive abilities — few studies include phenology
\item Leaf economic spectrum: spp fall along gradients of acquisitive (fast) growth to more conservative (slow) growth
\item Strategies that favour fast growth should promote early bb, spp that are better competitors with conservative growth bb later
\end{enumerate}

\item Could potentially set up hypotheses next
\begin{enumerate}
\item We predict that spp with traits associated with acquisitive growth (high SLA, high LNC, short heights, small seeds) will have low forcing, chilling, and photoperiod cue requirements
\item Spp that are better competitors with conservative growth bb later, with low SLA and LNC, tall heights, and large seeds, will have phenological response associated with high forcing, chilling, and photoperiod requirements
\end{enumerate}

\item Get into complexity of cues after hypotheses
\begin{enumerate}
\item trait ecology’s goal = predict sp-level characteristics by traits alone — how well we can do this to highly variable and species specific traits like phenology is unclear
\item field obs of phenology are highly variable — but under controlled environments and set cues, bb is highly predictable
\item traits themselves can be highly variable, both across and within spp - Violle paper ‘viva la variability’
\item Our model attributes phenological variation (day of bb) to species’ trait values while including residual variation from species (partial-pooling).
\item When traits explain a significant portion of the variation, spp will explain only a small amount — may be able to predict spp growth strategies and phenological responses from trait values.
\item Potential to use phenological data from controlled environment studies to identifying the relationship between sp cue responses and traits
\end{enumerate}

\item Here's what we do here.
\begin{enumerate}
\item we test for associations between plant phenological responses to environmental cues and common functional traits 
\item use available trait data from trait databases with bb data from controlled environment studies of woody plant species from the OSPREE database.
\item We focus on the effects of forcing, chilling, and photoperiod cues and four easy to measure traits — SLA, LNC, height, \& seed mass
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Need to fit in into intro, not sure where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cues address phenological variability
\item Be sure to clearly set up acquisitive vs. conservative
\end{enumerate}

Stuff we had, but could cut:
\begin{enumerate}
\item details of phenological responses - ectodormancy transition to endodormancy 
\item detailed definition of forcing, chilling, photoperiod
\end{enumerate}

Fig 1:
i) Can you confirm the slopes (when trait effect = 0) are constant across the top conceptual panels? If not, we should make them that way I think to minimize what changes across them?
DLDec15: Yes they are, the betaChill slope is always -2, betaForceSp =5 and betaPhotoSp = 1 for each plot

ii) Make sure the figure in the Supp that is similar has the same y axis scale -
DLDec15: I will fix that in the next draft for sure
