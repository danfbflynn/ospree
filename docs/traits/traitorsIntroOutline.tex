\title{Traitors intro}
\date{\today}

\maketitle 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Spring phenology is both ecologically important---carbon sequestration, species interactions etc--- also highly variable across years and species
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hallmark of the start of spring = budburst and leaf out of understory shrubs and spring ephemerals
\item Followed later in the season by budburst of taller trees and the closure of the forest canopy.
\item Have identified differences in spp. phenological events and key environmental cues shaping these differences (cite Flynn, and Laube)
\item Our understanding of why budburst is so diverse is still limited---does not relate to species overall growth strategies or larger niche space.
\end{enumerate} 

\item Timing of plant phenological events (budburst) define species' temporal niche = the partitioning of resources across species over time (Gotelli \& Granves 1996 - ch5).
\begin{enumerate}
\item temporal niche differenc determine the abiotic environment during growth and biotic interactions -- competitive landscape and pressures from herbivory.
\item This diversity of selective pressures (biotic and abiotic) is likely to correlate with diversity in other plant traits as well
\item A more holistic framework of the drivers of species temporal niches differences = important --- climate change is changing environmental conditions and habitats, shifting phenologies
%EMWJan8  -- I am not sure we toss in CC here (and very probably not cascading impacts), I think it may be too much for readers, so I commented out f the next two points ... you might be able to one of them in as a transition sentence before next part ... something more like 'understanding the drivers of species temporal niches is especially important now as CC is shifting phenology' or such. 
% \item Changes in climate are altering spp temporal niche, however, with earlier spring growth having cascading effects to ecological communities and spp interactions 
% \item But still have a limited mechanistic understanding of how specific spp will respond
%DLFeb3: I could see climate change being something that comes up in the discussion, so I am tempted to still mention it in the intro so it can be linked to 
\end{enumerate}


\item In budbursting over the span of several weeks, plants are likely to experience differences different selective pressures.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Species that bb in early in the spring = greater abiotic pressures, such as risk of false spring events and frost = potential loss of tissue, but benefit from more light and resource availability
\item Late spp have greater selection from biotic pressures = less light available and competition for resources 
%\item Differences in bb phenology within communities = important in shaping community dynamics including competition \& herbivory. %DLJan14: this seems repetitive 
\item Distribution of temporal niche within community influences the potential invasibility of a community--- invasive spp tend to be early bb with the potential to fill vacant niche space early in the season. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Considerable research = how functional traits relate to species growth strategies and competitive abilities — few studies include phenological traits.
\begin{enumerate}
\item timing of species growth likely to be related to species functional traits 
\item Shrub and other woody understory species tend to budburst earlier--- soil resources and light availability is greatest--- shorter, with leaf traits favourable to higher light availability (i.e. photosynthetic potential) and tolerance of late spring frost.
\item Canopy species budburst later--- taller, requiring greater wood densities, but more constant light compensates for their slower overall growth rates.
\item But later budbursting species must be better competitors --- compete with more species
\item Associations are intuitive but few studies have tested for similar gradients in growth strategies in phenological events across diverse species
\end{enumerate}

\item trait ecology’s goal = predict sp-level characteristics by traits alone %— how well we can do this to highly variable and species specific traits like phenology is unclear
\begin{enumerate}
\item Many leaf and wood traits do follow predictable gradients in their trait values, having associations that range from acquisitive (fast) growth strategies to more conservative (slow) growth strategies.
\item Collectively, these trait relationships lead to the development of the leaf economic spectrum and the wood economic spectrum
\item These frameworks have been built into decades of research linking functional traits to species responses to abiotic and biotic factors and community assembly
\item However, traits themselves can be highly variable, both across and within spp, highlighting the need for trait research that spans diverse species across geographic scales---Violle paper ‘viva la variability. 
\end{enumerate}

\item We tested for possible relationships between budburst phenological cues and other commonly measured functional traits.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We predict that spp with traits associated with acquisitive growth (high SLA, high LNC, short heights, small seeds) will have cue requirements associated with low forcing, chilling, and photoperiod
\item Spp that are better competitors with conservative growth and later budburst, with low SLA and LNC, tall heights, and large seeds, will have phenological response associated with high forcing, chilling, and photoperiod requirements
\end{enumerate}

\item Previous studies of budburst in woody trees have shown 3 cues are most important for spp responses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chilling - the period of cold temperatures from late fall to late winter, releases buds from dormancy
\item Forcing - the occurrence of warm temperatures in spring that initiate bud development 
\item Photoperiod - daylength
\item While field observations of phenology are highly variable — under controlled environments and set cues, bb is highly predictable
\item This suggests there is potential to use phenological data from controlled environment studies to identifying the relationship between species cue responses and traits
\end{enumerate}

\item We used available trait data from trait databases and bb data from the OSPREE database of controlled environment studies of woody plant species to test for associations between budburst responses to environmental cues and common functional traits
\begin{enumerate}
\item Focus on the effects of forcing, chilling, and photoperiod cues and four commonly measured traits — SLA, LNC, height, \& seed mass
\item Our model attributes phenological variation (day of bb) to species’ trait values while including residual variation from species (partial-pooling).
\item When traits explain a significant portion of the variation, spp will explain only a small amount — may be able to predict spp growth strategies and phenological responses from trait values.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Need to fit in into intro, not sure where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cues address phenological variability
\item Be sure to clearly set up acquisitive vs. conservative
\end{enumerate}

Stuff we had, but could cut:
\begin{enumerate}
\item details of phenological responses - ectodormancy transition to endodormancy -- Cutting this, too much other content
\item detailed definition of forcing, chilling, photoperiod
\end{enumerate}
