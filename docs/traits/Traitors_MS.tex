Observed changes in the phenologies of diverse species has become some of the strongest evidence we have for climate change, with widespread trends in species advancing the timing of their life history events. Advances in plant phenological events, such as budburst, leafout, and flowering times in temperate systems are associated with changes in seasonal temperatures, particularly warming winter and spring conditions \citep{MillerRushing2008, Menzel2006, Fitter2002b}. Despite this strong general trend, phenological responses have been found to vary across species and geographically \citep{Chuine2010}. The relationships between environmental cues and phenological events define for example, the duration of the growing season, the trajectory of community assembly, species ranges, and ecosystem services \citep{White1997, Chuine2010, Cleland2007}, ultimately shaping and mitigating the impact of climate change on forest communities.

Over the past several decades considerable efforts have been invested in identifying the effects of individual environmental cues on spring phenological events of temperate woody plants. Three cues -- chilling, forcing, and photoperiod -- are known to be the primary proximate drivers of budburst and leafout \citep{Chuine2016}. For budburst to occur, species must experience sufficient winter chilling, requiring extended period of cold temperatures to break dormancy \citep{Cooke2012, Ritchie2003}. High chill requirements are associated with later budburst, however, rising winter temperatures may result in either insufficient chilling in systems where temperatures remain above the required temperature threshold or a faster rate of chilling accumulation if periods of extremely low temperatures become less frequent \citep{Guy2014}. Spring forcing or the spring temperatures required by species to initiate growth after dormancy has been released, is also changing as temperatures warm and the timing of suitable temperatures for growth occurs earlier in the season \citep{citation}. Some species also have specific requirements for daylength, or photoperiod, to initiate growth \citep{}. Previous studies support the general trend of advancing budburst with each cue \citep{Flynn2018}, however, the relative importance of different cues vary across species \citep{Chuine2016?, citations}. Some woody plant species, for example, require less forcing to budburst after experiencing a cool winter with more chilling, while also being able to compensate for low chilling in warm winters if high forcing conditions \citep{Laube2014, Harrington2015}. Photoperiod also appears to compensate for low chilling and forcing conditions  \citep{Flynn2018,  Caffarra2011, Basler2014,  Zohner2016}. Evidence for the role of photoperiod is largely species specific  \citep{Heide1993, Basler2014, Singh2017, Zohner2016}, with few studies testing for its importance across species in a community (but see  \citep{Flynn2018}. Species that are less dependent on photoperiod cues and able to track trends in temperatures may benefit from greater intra-annual phenotypic plasticity resulting in greater fitness outcomes under increasingly variable climates \citep{citation}. Despite the insights that identifying these proximate drivers have provided, we still lack the generalizable and mechanistic understanding of why species and populations differ in their cue use that is needed to predict future changes in species sensitivities and community structures.

In our efforts to understand the observed variation we see in spring phenologies, previous research have aimed to identify key factors in determining species cue use. Intraspecific cue use has been shown to vary with the age or development stage of woody plants. Younger life stages, including both seedlings and younger understory trees both budburst earlier than mature individuals in the canopy, reflecting both differences in their temperature sensitivities and more ontogenic changes as trees mature \citep{Vitasse2013, Seiwa1999}. Differences in phenologies across species have also been assessed in relation to a species phylogenetic relatedness. These studies suggest that within taxonomic families, events like flowering-time and budburst are consistent and reflect phylogenetic conservatism in the genetic and physiological mechanisms that determine species phenologies \citep{Kochmer1986, Davies2013}. Other work has focused on the relationships between phenology and geographic gradients, including latitude and range limits, based on the assumption that woody plant phenologies reflect local adaptations to climate cues within a species native range \citep{Lechowicz1984, Chuine2001, Chuine2010}. \citep{Zohner2017} observed associations between greater temperature variation in the spring and higher chilling requirements of species in North America compared to species native to Europe and Asia. More variable spring conditions in North America are hypothesized to have selected for more conservative phenological responses as a means of mitigating disturbance events such as late season frosts \citep{citations}. Across species latitudinal ranges, stronger responses to photoperiod cues have been observed at lower latitudes. Exploring these potential drivers of plant phenologies have added to our understanding of nuanced nature of phenology in shaping diverse communities. They still, however, are limited in the degree to which they explain the variation we observe across species and ecosystems.

Previous work has demonstrated the importance of both the evolutionary history of a species and environmental cues in shaping species phenologies and therefore the temporal niche of a species. However, few studies have directly explored the potential for traits to drive niche partitioning and their relationship to variation in cue use. Trade-offs in the timing of resource availability and growth, disturbance regimes, or abiotic risk factors likely also shape species phenologies. Plant functional traits have been identified as good proxies for these tradeoffs and have the potential to offer new insights into the relationships between climate, environmentally determined phenological events like budburst, and gradients in functional traits.

Functional trait data collected across diverse and global assemblages of deciduous plants have be used to identify several key axes of trait variation reflective of different trends in resource use and growth. These commonly measured traits, which include specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry mass content (LDMC), height, stem specific density, and seed mass, are associated with gradients of fast, more resource acquisitive growth to slower, conservative growth. Species that exhibit faster growth, with shorter rates of return on resource investments, budburst earlier within a season during periods of high resource availability and low competition. This strategy favours species that can sustain the costs of higher frost risk early in the growing season, possessing wood and leaf traits that either mitigate the effects of frost damage or produce leaves at a lower cost if lost to damage. This can be achieved by producing leaves that have high SLA, as lower tissue densities and greater leaf area, high leaf nitrogen content that supports greater photosynthetic potential, while also investing less into height and seed size. This suite of traits contrast those with slower growth strategies that benefit competitively from slower rates of return on resource investment and the longer retention of leaf tissue. Budbursting later in the growing season, when competition for soil and light resources in lower is a favourable strategy for species with lower SLA, low LNC, greater heights and stem specific density and larger seeds. This suite of traits contrast those with slower growth strategies that benefit competitively from slower rates of return on resource investment and the longer retention of leaf tissue. Budbursting later in the growing season, when competition for soil and light resources in lower is a favourable strategy for species with lower SLA, low LNC, greater heights and stem specific density and larger seeds. While traits can fall along a continuum across these axes, this trait focused framework is useful to identify generalizable trends across species independent of geography. As a functional trait, phenology has been less frequently incorporated into broader trait studies. Recent studies have found support for the existence of trade-offs in phenology and traits associated with the aforementioned growth strategies \citep{citations from Kelly's review}. However, studies conducted within single sites or on few focal species are limited in their abilities to draw causal inferences. Differences in phenological events across species and sites may be better accounted for using variability in key environmental cues and measurable differences in their suite of traits rather than species identify alone. % This paragraph is weak, these ideas need to be developed further

Although there have been numerous studies investigating the relationships between climate and functional traits and a wealth of literature on the effects of climate cues as drivers of phenology, very few studies have addressed the interrelatedness of traits, phenological responses, and climate drivers. Work on this ‚Ä¶..focused on a small subset of herbaceous? Woody species?

In woody plant species, the associations between budburst and abiotic cues, including mean annual temperatures and precipitation, have been previously tested and shown to be important drivers in many species \citep{citation}. These cues, however, are directly linked to the forcing and chilling conditions experienced, but have rarely been associated with functional traits or the underlying growth strategies these can infer.  In this study, we will explicitly test for associations between functional traits and trends in budburst and species forcing, chilling, and photoperiod cues. We use global data from the OSPREE database of deciduous woody plant species along with functional trait data from the TRY and BIEN trait databases to identify broad, generalizable trends across species globally. This study focuses on four commonly measured functional traits, SLA, LNC, height, and seed mass, traits that are well represented within the trait databases and known trait schemes, including the leaf economic spectrum \citep{Wright2004} and the classic leaf-height-seed scheme proposed by \cite{Westoby1998}. Drawing on this body of work, we hypothesize that species that budburst under low chilling, low forcing, and short photoperiod conditions may have traits associated with faster growth, but low competitiveness, which may be reflected by high SLA, high LNC, shorter heights, and lower seed mass. In contrast, species that budburst earlier under high chilling or high forcing temperatures, with long photoperiods are predicted to have traits associated with higher competitive abilities, such as low SLA, low LNC, greater heights and heavier seeds.
