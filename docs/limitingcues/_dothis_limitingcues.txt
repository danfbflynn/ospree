<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

16 March 2022 lab meeting
- parlance — we think of statistical interactions; development folks think of the development pathway
- ask Dan fro pollen cores paper with conceptual figures he mentioned

DUE: 25th March 2022

To do ...
	(*) Get some papers to read (Bhalero, those ones Isabelle likes by Satake and Nagano, the ones reviewers mention, Rinne? ... history of Utah units?)
	(*) Write down all the suggested topics from reviewers and try to organize into new paragraph on future directions (esp. R2) 


Papers:
- Singh that I have on my computer (a few)
- Downloads in limitingcues folder
- Luedeling 2011 (printed)
- Chew et al. 2012

Small things to fix when bounced however from NPH (Dec 2021)
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

Fix 'forcingonly' (currently one word) on Figure 1.  

Notes on Asse2018 (I cut it, but I think maybe I should not have ... perhaps add back in someday): 
- I agree, I think we should cut the Asse et al., 2018 reference because they don’t include the interaction in the model, just GDD + Chilling in some models. Nice catch! 
- From Nacho: Regarding Asse 2018, the interactions they refer to (identified through variance partitioning) are not explicitly modelled. I believe they just checked that some proportion of shared explained variance among predictors would be negative (thus indicating interaction) but they don’t care to do anything about it.

Sep 2021 efforts to re-submit somewhere
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

As of 3 December 2021..
I think I have done most of these, search for NOT below for any I didn't do....

Messages we want to come through: 
- Six decades of experiments are not enough identify interactive effects of photoperiod and temperature on spring phenology
- (Put another way...) our key message that -- okay, we cannot use observational data to do this, we need experiments, we have decades of these experiments and still cannot partition them (and we're trying to reach experimental biologists)


Other to do items:
- Make section headers more declarative and then CUT them so that they match to that header text. 
- Make the take home messages of the figures super clear (even if it means you do not hit every message you wanted to). 

Where? (Currently 5K)

New Phytologist (if we cut it down to 4K)
Journal of Experimental Botany
Ag Forest Met

Title: 
- Do interactive effects of temperature and photoperiod shapespring plant phenology responses to warming? Data limitations....
- Data limitations to predicting interactive effects of temperature and photoperiod on spring plant phenology
- Integrating experiments to predict the interactive effects of temperature and photoperiod on spring phenological responses to warming
- Six decades of experiments cannot identify interactive effects of photoperiod and temperature on spring phenology


Sections/ideas:

1.1 retitle: observational studies are not enough (BTW, they have to be experiments, and the right type of experiments)

New section of: interactions alone do not produce non-linearities 

Can we show the outcome of getting this wrong? (NOT done.)

Figure 4 caption: Stress what the gray means, stress that we're good at 8 hours and 16 hours ... 

Clarify that spring phenology is what we can do with cuttings ... we can't easily do this with flowers etc. (This is a place we can get good leverage.)


Other edits:

Abstract: Maybe instead of arguing for more integration to start we say we don't really have the best data to estimate these and then argue for more integration? ... Also, (l 55-57) this is what we do that's novel: "We then synthesize controlled environment studies to quantify how much of the cue-space (i.e., the possible range of each cue and interactions across cues) has been studied and how treatments compare to shifts in cues caused by climate change."

Abstract should also be more clear about *interactions* ...

Last paragraph of intro could be adapted to better contrast what we do here ... we show that data across experiments. (NOT sure I did this well)

Could potentially cut a fair bit of "1.2 How will chilling, forcing and photoperiod shift with climate change?" section. Some could go into a figure caption ... and mainly focus on lines 153 onward in that section?

Digest caption of Fig. 4 better.

Stronger statements throughout perhaps? About what is missing or inadequate. Do we want to say that current explanations of how non-linearities should come about are often vague? And that's why we have Figure 1?

Cite Ailene's paper for ideas on how to integrate these experimental studies into larger models? (NOT done)

Add some refs (Baumgarten etc.)

* Who is the audience?
- Experimental biologists because we need to more experiments: is our key message that -- okay, we cannot use observational data to do this, we need experimnts, we have decades of these experiments and still cannot partition them. 
- People who forecast phenology

Lab said ...

Ailene: As for authorship, I have no preference at all- TNC does not care where I am and neither do I. I feel like you have clearly driven this paper, and you probably have the best idea of who put in large amounts of effort and what the order should be.  I do not feel that I put in a large amount of work, so please list me in whatever position you feel reflects that! I honestly have no preference at all. Thank you for asking, though!

Cat: No strong preference 

Dan: No strong feelings about authorship

Nacho: The Spanish system is quite particular (and annoying) about quantifying author contributions, so yes, my institution and evaluators would favor a last position over a second. However, I will be happy with whatever author order you decide


What Figures to move to supp?

2. (i)
3. i
4. iii 
5. iii 
6. i (i) or combine with 5 ... but Nacho votes to keep Fig 6

Going to supp! 
Fig 4 (the map)
Fig 5 (the studies over time)

Maybe start at these ...

(1) Nature Plants (https://www.nature.com/nplants/about/content also note about presubmission inquiries: . If your manuscript is already written please proceed with a full formal submission.) Review is 3000-4000 words with 4-6 figures and 100 citations

(2) GCB (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13652486/homepage/forauthors.html) Research Reviews examine a defined specialist subject that is of topical interest. Reviews should begin with an abstract and an introduction, followed by up to 10 sections following a logically developed plan, and end with a Conclusion. Reviews should be no more than 8000 words (count includes Abstract, Introduction, body, Conclusions and Acknowledgements).

(3 or 4?) Journal of Experimental Botany (https://academic.oup.com/jxb/pages/what-does-jxb-publish) Review or Darwin review ... 6500 words

(3 or 4?) ELE -- did not check but pretty sure its 6-8K words


NEE -- identical to Nature Plants

New Phyt -- 3500-4000K unless we got a Tansey (https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/14698137/about/author-guidelines#5 Short Research reviews should be in the range of 3,500–4,000 words, with up to 60 references and six figures/tables. Following a short introduction, putting the area into context, and providing a ‘way in’ for the non-specialist, these will concentrate on the most recent developments in the field. We also commission content, such as Commentaries, Meeting reports, Tansley reviews and Tansley insights. Enquiries or suggestions about these or other types of article are always welcome.) 


AFM (your article, your way but you still need highlights; https://www.elsevier.com/journals/agricultural-and-forest-meteorology/0168-1923/guide-for-authors)

Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment (https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/15409309/resources/author-guidelines-FEE#Reviews) Length: about 150 words for the abstract, 3000 words, not including a short abstract, not more than 35 references, and a total of 4/5 figures, tables, and/or panels

Ecological Modeling -- good if we end up in a cascade? (Also Elsevier, so also your article your way)

Nacho/Cat: My preferred order would be NatPlants, GCB, ELE, JEB (perhaps if we end up going to this last one I would emphasize the focus on controlled experiments in the title). I was wondering if it should include/mention/stress somehow that a strong focus of the paper is on how controlled experiments can improve our predictive ability of climate change effects on phenology. I’m aware doing so could under-sell the paper as it might sound too specific, but just in case you want to consider.

Should we call them cues or cue levels or ...?
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

As of Feb 2021, I sort of feel fine with how it is says Lizzie, see what co-authors say.

Previously I wrote ...
Cues is not a good term as we use it -- the environment does not CHANGE cues, does it? It changes the experienced cue ... or the response predicted at that level of the cue. We need to refine our language. ... Gauzere says cue for presence of a response (e.g., to photoperiod) ... they also use `compensatory effects of chilling on forcing requirements' ... as a way to subadditive I believe. They seem to describe the underlying curves as responses (e.g., `chilling and forcing responses') ... hmm, but they also say stuff like: "the effective response to day length simulated by the models can highly differ according to the adjusted reaction norms" so maybe response curve and reaction norm are interchangeable?

Salk 2020

"I focus mostly on what I call ‘cueing mechanisms’ (e.g. spring tempera- ture, chilling, photoperiod) rather than ‘cues’ (e.g. the specific critical photoperiod or degree-day requirement of a plant) as these are more likely to be a shared feature within a species. Because of its fundamental importance for carbon balance, especially in deciduous species (Dragoni et al. 2011), this paper focuses on leafing phenology in temperate and boreal trees."

Chmura et al. 2019 defines, "Cue: an attribute of the environment that initiates a phenological response" but their definitions are beyond that sort of sloppy (
