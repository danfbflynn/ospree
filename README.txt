Wolkovich Lab > Budburst Review - Ospree

This includes lots of old notes from 2015 and early 2016 when the project started. 
It also includes the climate data. 

## Ospree Climate (external hard drive)
Just the climate data. 

Justin Sheffield’s v3 of the Princeton Global Forcing dataset data:
http://hydrology.princeton.edu/data/pgf/v3/0.25deg/daily/
Update by Lizzie in March 2023: This website is still down (it was down in late Nov 2022). I chatted with Ben Cook who recommended we cite this site for our papers (0.5 resolution but same dataset): https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/input-data-bias-adjustment/details/2/ ... E. Wood has died and thus Princeton may have taken down the site. 

##Phenofit data came from Isabelle Chuine (Isabelle.CHUINE@cefe.cnrs.fr) and Ann Duputie (anne.duputie@univ-lille1.fr), corresponds to the following paper: Duputie, A, et al. 2015. Phenological plasticity will not help all species adapt to climate change. Global Change Biology. doi: 10.1111/gcb.12914
